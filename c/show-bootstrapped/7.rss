            <p>Hi all, some of you may remember me as the former owner of Saber Feedback. I’ve been living the 9-5 life for a couple of years now, but the old side project itch has returned <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blush.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>
<p>I realise this community is not long for this world, but I’d really appreciate feedback from you all on my <em>very</em> early stage project. (It’s just a demo video and some basic questions at the moment)</p>

            <p>Hey Everyone,<br>
Today my partner and I launched our company, <a href="http://demostory.io">demostory.io</a>. A browser built for live software demos, it eliminates the need to log in and out, jump between browser windows, and you can save the entire demo and launch it in seconds!</p>
<p>My experience is as an SE doing large enterprise demos. Chrome is great for every-day-use, unfortunately though those same features can complicate your demo especially if you want to show multiple users or collaboration.</p>
<p>Me and my cofounder bootstrapped this ourselves with the help of online forums like this + fiverr and upwork.</p>
<p>We have a free 1 month trail and would love some feedback. If you are bootstrapping your startup and find the tool useful reach out to me we can work something out.</p>

            <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I just launched my new project: TempEmailify a browser extension for <strong>Quick</strong> short-lived email accounts for free.</p>
<p>tempemailify.versoly.page</p>
<p>Thinking about the problems I use to face while building web applications. I took my note, started listing out problems and the solutions I used at that time. By analyzing I found a simple problem on the usability of temp-email extensions.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a problem worth solving that led me to the idea for TempEmailify!</p>
<p>Any feedback is more than welcome!</p>

          <title>Modern, and social, travel planning. Finally, no more spreadsheets!</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[BluePlanit]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Show Bootstrapped</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>My friends and I built Blue Planit, a travel planning app, to accomplish two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make it faster and easier to plan a trip.<br>
<strong>How</strong> - autofill event details and mark on map. Fast drag and drop of events with all details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable anyone to discover itineraries others have created and start planning with existing trips. <strong>How</strong> - copy the entirety of existing trips others have created that can then be customized.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We built Blue Planit because when planning our own trips, we always defaulted to using a shared Google Doc and marking Google Maps. It was always so manual and time consuming, so we decided to build a more integrated and automated solution that also brought the social aspect of discovering trip itineraries others have made. We loved the design of Trello so were inspired to use dran-n-drop cards in our design.</p>
<p>Would love for you to check it out and provide any feedback after you’ve tried it out! (Google “blue planit”, I can’t post a link)</p>

            <p>Hey y’all! Currently working on a project called ZigZag, which is an ios app.</p>
<p>On the app, users can co-create videos with as many friends as they like. Once videos go live on the feed, all of the likes &amp; comments are attributed to all contributors - so everyone is rewarded for creating “viral content”.</p>
<p>Would love for y’all to check it out &amp; feedback us! You can find it by searching “ZigZag video” in the App Store.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Side Project : Games with Gran</p>
<p>I’ve built a side project - <strong><a href="https://www.gameswithgran.com/">Games With Gran</a></strong>.</p>
<p>“Classic games like Tic Tac Toe &amp; Four in a Row and Checkers with built in super simple and secure video conferencing to help keep your family in touch.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gameswithgran.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.gameswithgran.com/</a></p>
<p>The idea was born in Covid Lockdowns to try and help my Grandparents keep in touch with my young kids using simple games.</p>
<p>As with all the best side projects I’ve given ZERO thought in how to market this or monitize this (though thats not a priority to be fair, should be very modest cost to run).</p>
<p>Hopefully some of you may find it useful.</p>
<p>Any ideas especially on Marketing / Monitizing?</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’m the author of the <a href="https://datatables.net">DataTables</a> Javascript library and have been working on a SaaS version of the software - basically hosted tables which you can perform CRUD operations on - the result is <a href="https://cloudtables.com">CloudTables</a>.</p>
<p>To some degree it can be likened to AirTable, but we are going for full integration with your site - embedding directly into it, not just as an iframe. We also are building on our DataTables and Editor products (along with all the extensions we publish for them) so it has really strong foundations. CloudTables is basically a UI around DataTables and Editor.</p>
<p>Why this approach? Running DataTables (open source) and Editor (commercial) as developer libraries takes a <em>lot</em> of support effort, so with CloudTables we are progressing a little away from targeting code only developers, to provide a service which is more suited to those who just want to get CRUD table basics done so they can get on with other aspects of the business and also those who are perhaps newer to programming. Hopefully it will reduce the support burden while also opening a new revenue stream.</p>
<p>I’d really welcome feedback not just on the landing page, but also the initial flow of getting started - creating a new CloudTable and using it!</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Allan</p>

<p>I’ve banged simple analytics that pulls its data from Google Analytics, mostly because I don’t have the nerve to jump on all the Google’s sidebar menus.</p>
<p>PS. From Saturday till today I’ve noticed a significant drop in traffic in one of my websites. Compared with the web hosting AwStats and the difference is astonishing. Could this be related with the Google infrastructure recently being down?</p>

<p>What are the main differences between running desktop apps versus web apps? And which of the two comes with less hassle and problems down the line? Our guest today is Steve McLeod, the founder of Feature Upvote and acquirer of Saber Feedback. You’ll hear Steve’s opinion on switching from desktop to web-based apps, the various maintenance and support issues that may arise, the “boring” aspects of running complex software, and how to prevent the stress that often comes with SaaS.</p>

          <title>Show Bootstrapped: Introducing SeeLink - A Link Sharing and Collaboration Platform</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[_RN]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Show Bootstrapped</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello Bootstrapped Community!</p>
<p>I’m proud to introduce a web-app I’ve been working on for the past few months, SeeLink.</p>
<p>SeeLink is a link sharing and collaboration platform that enables you to save and share links from all around the web.</p>
<p><strong>What’s SeeLink For?</strong></p>
<p>SeeLink is one of the first link sharing and collaboration platforms. SeeLink enables its users to store, share, and save links from all around the web. You could use SeeLink to store links of your interest, and share them with friends, family, or teammates.</p>
<p><strong>Why was SeeLink created?</strong></p>
<p>SeeLink was created to simplify sharing links with friends and family. Conventionally, sharing links with people was done through messaging apps, where they would get lost in the sea of messages. SeeLink allows its users to create boards to share links with specific people, allowing them to save and share human-readable links at the click of a button.</p>
<p>There’s still a lot that I’d like to improve in SeeLink, and if there’s anything you’d like to see added to that list, please let me know! Also, I’m looking to get some user feedback before I launch to more people, so all feedback is welcome!</p>

          <title>My latest project - a data management tool</title>

            <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>It’s been a couple of years since I’ve posted here.  I’ve had a number of failed attempts at starting a software business, and eventually took a break from that idea after actually finding a well-paying software job that wasn’t horrible (on the bright side, my last project, though it failed utterly as a business, played a part in helping me get my current job).</p>
<p>Well, the lockdown happened, I got bored with all the extra time, and started on an open source project at least partially inspired by problems I’d faced at work over the last several years:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rhinoman/odmp">OpenDMP</a></p>
<p>It’s a platform meant to serve as a foundation for a (small) organization’s data management needs.</p>
<p>Screenshot!:</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to push the thought that this could grow into a business (i.e., open-core, services, etc.) to the back of my mind (to not get ahead of myself) until I can see if it catches on or not.  It’s fairly early in development, needs more documentation, etc., but I’d appreciate any feedback and/or advice - esp. on the how to promote an open source project front <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

          <title>Website owners, I need your help testing my lighthouse audit tool!</title>

            <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>I’m currently working on a tool runs automated website tests for SEO, Performance and other Lighthouse metrics: <a href="http://www.keeperapp.io/">www.keeperapp.io</a></p>
<p>The main functionality is done, so now I’d like to gather as much websites as possible so every base is covered. I could add the generic cases like <a href="http://google.com/">google.com</a> or <a href="http://facebook.com/">facebook.com</a> but I need to be sure it works for every website out there! That’s where you come in. For the moment the tool is free to use, and as a thank you, beta testers will be able to keep their accounts (and its perks) for free after launch.</p>
<p>With this tool we aimed at making the lives easier of Digital Marketers and website owners. We wanted to make performance and metric testing as easy as possible while making sure all your data is completely in your hands. No installation needed, no service needs to be kept updated, any public-facing page can be tested (even that one competitor you need to keep an eye on).</p>
<p>Really looking forward to your feedback, any bugs can be reported using the red bug button in the lower right corner (after logging in) of your screen!</p>
<p>Cheers, Denis</p>

          <title>SpreadTheWorld - An Acquisition Channels Database for Startups</title>

            <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I just launched my new project: <a href="https://spreadtheworld.net?utm_source=into-post&amp;utm_medium=bootstrapfm">https://spreadtheworld.net/</a></p>
<p>It’s a database of 400+ places where you can post your project and get your first users.</p>
<p>The idea came from a list of startup directories I curated to launch my previous startup. I posted it on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/im1q7y/i_curated_100_website_where_you_can_promote_your/">Reddit</a> and get tons of upvotes.<br>
So I decided to go deeper, provide more value for the makers/entrepreneurs, and make a product out of it!</p>
<p>It’s still in a pre-order, so any feedback is more than welcome!</p>

            <p>Hey! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wave.png?v=9" title=":wave:" class="emoji" alt=":wave:"></p>
<p><a href="https://colouring.xyz">I present to you Colouring!</a> A very simple-to-use tool that converts any image into a ready-to-colour image <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/grinning.png?v=9" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>
<p>I thought to myself: there’s probably a lot of parents out there thinking of ways to keep their kids entertained during the lockdown - maybe I can do something to help? So I built this! A one-click web app that converts any image into a colouring one <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/art.png?v=9" title=":art:" class="emoji" alt=":art:"></p>
<p>Let me know what you think, and any constructive feedback is welcomed! Thanks</p>

          <title>Working on a new app that injects a bunch of custom emoji into your Slack/Discord workspace. Would love your thoughts!</title>

            <p>Hey there folks! Working on a new side project/toy for avid users of conversational workspaces like Slack and Discord. If you’re anything like me and the teams on which I participate, emojis are a huge element of our banter and conversations. We’re also fans of the custom emoji features, but finding the right emoji (especially for an in-the-moment reaction) is sometimes tough.</p>
<p>So we’re building an app that injects a boat load of custom emojis into these workspaces for you. We’re in the research phase at the moment and hoping to gather feedback and ideas from communities who use these apps often. Please check out the idea at <strong>moji.studio</strong> (yep, that’s the URL) and click the Sign Up button to answer a few quick questions (literally about 2 minutes).</p>
