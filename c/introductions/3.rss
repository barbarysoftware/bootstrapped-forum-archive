          <title>Hi, I&#39;m Tom from HelpfulDocs (we create and manage your help content)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[helpfuldocs]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Introductions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi all, I’m Tom Sylvan from the HelpfulDocs team. I’m very excited to be here <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><strong>Here is what we do:</strong><br>
Good help content (such as knowledge base articles and product updates) is crucial for the success of any product. This is especially true for serve-serve products where users have to onboard themselves, and learn how to use the product on their own.</p>
<p>We’ve worked for quite a few companies and almost every team struggled to build the necessary workflows that ensured the help content was always correct and updated. And when they did, there was a human resource bottleneck: who will write and update the content on a recurring basis?</p>
<p>Having old or inconsistent documentation impacts directly every product business, even though it’s hard to measure this. It impacts conversion rates and churn, as it makes it harder to use and learn the product. It also makes both sales (if you do sales) and support more demanding as you need to spend more time explaining the same things and answering the same questions.</p>
<p>So HelpfulDocs is the solution to this problem: a help content creation agency that builds automated workflows for ensuring help content always correct and updated. We focus on help content both in-app (e.g., onboarding guides, product updates, changelogs etc.) and in external tools (e.g., your website, help center, CMS, email marketing tool, etc.)</p>

            <p>Hi, I’m Andrew, originally from Ireland.</p>
<p>I worked over the past few years in product and ops at a number of startups (primarily in SE Asia). Now, I’ve started NeoCoach, an app that pairs you 1-on-1 with an expert coach.</p>
<p>Ever think it’s funny that we outsource many things in our life (our haircuts, medical advice, accounting, teaching) but often try to manage our fitness completely on our own? NeoCoach is changing that!</p>
<p>At a very early stage of company building and I hope I can find some helpful tips in this community as well as contribute my fair share. I’m glad to be a part of this community and look forward to meeting you all.</p>
<p>Any and all feedback is always sought after, and more than happy to offer the community access if anyone is interested <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I’m Michel from Brussels, Belgium.</p>
<p>I’ve been perfecting my cold outreach skills for the last 2 years and decided to create a list of resources that would have helped me 2 years ago.</p>
<p>It’s called <strong>ColdIQ</strong> and all the resources are available for free. It’s been sorted in an order that makes outbound sales easy to learn. Excited to hear your feedback and always down to connect.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            <p>Hi, I’m Reinhard from Austria.</p>
<p>I worked the last 20 years as a web developer and started recently my SaaS business called <a href="https://form.taxi/en">Form.taxi</a>. It’s a handy online service which provides a backend for web forms submissions.</p>
<p>To bring a new product to live and then to success is an exciting adventure. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/grinning.png?v=9" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"><br>
The field of sales and marketing is quite new to me and I hope I can find here some helpful tips. I’m glad to be a part of this community and look forward to an active knowledge sharing.</p>

            <p>This community and podcast seem to be drawing me in by housing a lot of likeminded individuals. I’m the founder of <a href="https://mxroute.com/">MXroute</a>, a rapidly growing company I started while working as an angry sysadmin, minus the proper beard, while I worked at HostGator. I started my road to recovery as I moved on to DigitalOcean and then QuickPacket, and then finally went full time working directly for my customers.</p>
<p>It all started with a credit card and a bottle of everclear, and pretty soon I’ll be hiring someone else to help build out the product (I’m a back-end dev/sysadmin making a full service, which means front-end is lacking).</p>
<p>Hope to learn a few things from the likeminded people here and maybe even share some wisdom I’ve picked up along the way.</p>

            <p>Hey bootstrapped, this is Mike, from Mexico.</p>
<p>I’m an entrepreneur building  projects. I’ve been launching different projects in the last few months, but I always encounter issues to get the first customers without unpaid marketing.</p>
<p>The one that I’m working on at this time is “iSawDesign”. It’s an unlimited web design and graphic design service for startups</p>
<p>I’m really good when it comes to Google Ads and Facebook campaigns, but I’ve found it to be nearly impossible to invest in these when targeting the US market.</p>
<p>If you have any advice as to how y’all have acquired the first few customers, please share the knowledge <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Hey bootstrappers!</p>
<p>My goal is to help you go from idea to product-market fit so you can raise funding if you want or keep on bootstrapping.  I feel like my goal is to help you reduce risk of working on the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Currently I work at a tech startup as a conversion rate optimization but the machines are coming for my job <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’m look forward to seeing what this is all about.</p>

          <title>Hello! I&#39;m Justin Higgins and I know nothing about sales and marketing so I built 24hourhomepage.com</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Justin_Higgins]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Introductions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <h1>Hello Bootstrapped !</h1>
<p>I’m Justin Higgins and I know nothing about sales and marketing.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>I’ve been a professional software engineer for over 10 years now and have wanted to build something of my own. I’ve tried a few side projects but have had a pretty big flaw in my thinking execution:</p>
<p>I never wanted to <em>sell or market</em> my work.</p>
<p>That’s no good.</p>
<p>So I built <strong>24hourhomepage (dot) com</strong> in order to get better at sales and marketing.</p>
<p>The service is simple:<br>
There are 86,400 seconds in a day and each is sold as an advertisement. Once each second is sold, the project is over and the site lives on indefinitely as an internet artifact.</p>
<h2>Why would I advertise here?</h2>
<p>There are endless reasons why people are advertising on <strong>24hourhomepage (dot) com</strong>, but here are a few:</p>
<h3>1. Cost <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/moneybag.png?v=9" title=":moneybag:" class="emoji" alt=":moneybag:">
</h3>
<p>Traditional digital advertisements are expensive and often based on pay-per-click (PPC) model. Here, you buy your ad once and keep it forever.</p>
<h3>2. Captive and engaged audience <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/eyes.png?v=9" title=":eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":eyes:">
</h3>
<p>24hourhomepage (dot) com visitors <em><strong>want</strong></em> to click an ad. There is no better engagement out there. For viewers who set us as their homepage, they’re not only <strong>an engaged audience</strong> they’re <strong>a captive audience.</strong></p>
<h3>3. Have fun with your brand <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/surfing_man.png?v=9" title=":surfing_man:" class="emoji" alt=":surfing_man:">‍♂</h3>
<p>You can “hide” discounts or jokes on the site as easter eggs for your customers. It’s cost effective and lets your customers know you aren’t afraid to have fun.</p>
<h3>4. Vanity <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/gem.png?v=9" title=":gem:" class="emoji" alt=":gem:">
</h3>
<p>You can tell everyone you “own” a piece of the day. Or buy your sweetie her birthsecond. Or invest in your idea by claiming the link won’t be dead far in the future.</p>
<h3>5. Money back guarantee <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/100.png?v=9" title=":100:" class="emoji" alt=":100:">
</h3>
<p>All sales are made with a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you want a refund, you get a refund.</p>
<h1>I’d love to hear your feedback <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/ear.png?v=9" title=":ear:" class="emoji" alt=":ear:">

          <title>Hello! Introducing LIFE Intelligence</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[lifeintelligence]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Introductions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi everyone, new here. I run a self therapy / productivity app called LIFE Intelligence. We’re moving into Android beta soon if anyone is into self development and wants to join in.</p>
<p>Not really sure what else is appropriate for an intro, but pasting below our product hunt description so you get an idea <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Last year, I left my dream job at a hedge fund to create the product I wish I’d had. As an investor, I had all this research and analysis to back up my stock picks. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/chart_with_upwards_trend.png?v=9" title=":chart_with_upwards_trend:" class="emoji" alt=":chart_with_upwards_trend:"> But why hadn’t I put the same sort of rigorous study into my most important investment: me?</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on many of us. However, the problem I see is bigger than mental fitness. It’s threefold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Self, career, and relationships are intertwined. Missing any one piece of the puzzle misses the full picture and cure. Yet, most apps focus on just one vertical.</li>
<li>Content that lacks depth and nuance is going to bore a Type-A like me. I wanted something science-backed with real “ah-ha” moments.</li>
<li>“Tell me and I forget… involve me and I learn.” A lot of us jump to seeking advice from others. Yet, coming to conclusions on our own makes lessons stick much longer.</li>
</ol>
<p>I couldn’t find this type of holistic education anywhere, so I decided to research and write it myself. My requirements for differentiation were:</p>
<ol>
<li>A comprehensive course/training/tool that</li>
<li>Was backed in science with no fluff and</li>
<li>Could make me my own coach or therapist: actionable, efficient, with lasting change</li>
</ol>
<p>Having written a thesis at Princeton, I knew there were decades of psychology research that rarely reach those who could benefit from it most: users like you and me. So, I took my skill set studying stocks and applied it to the biggest life questions I had. Today, the result of that effort is a comprehensive course and cognitive training. It’s taken months of research and writing to create not only complete content that gets at the “how,” but also a thoughtful, curated flow.</p>
<p>Inside, you’ll see we offer three main features.</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blue_book.png?v=9" title=":blue_book:" class="emoji" alt=":blue_book:"> (1) First is a 9-Mission course, comprised of hundreds of 5-min bite-sized daily lessons of snippet reading and reflection. To:</p>
<p>1 Build mental resilience and emotional management skills<br>
2 Develop self-awareness and emotional intelligence<br>
3 Discover values, set goals, track habits, stay motivated<br>
4 Minimize regret and manage time<br>

<p>I spent a great deal of time researching the basis of emotions. How is envy different from jealousy? How do we categorize them? Do they belong in anger, disgust, or sadness? I drew from multiple academic sources to build a mood wheel. It might actually be the part of the app I’m most proud of </p>
<p>Why is this so important? Sometimes I would feel “bad” but be unable to pinpoint how I was feeling or what was bothering me. After looking into it, I discovered that “emotional granularity,” or the ability to name exact emotions, is the first step to gaining control over moods. LIFE’s user-friendly mood wheel gets super specific, and is sorted by color as well as intensity, so you can see how moods, like colors, combine or change in intensity.</p>
<p>After choosing your mood, you’ll find exact coping, communication, and problem-solving exercises that can get you out of your bad mood in minutes. For example, if I’m frustrated, I can use the 5-Whys exercise to figure out the root cause. If I’m insecure, I can use a self-affirmation exercise. And so on.</p>
<p><img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/love_letter.png?v=9" title=":love_letter:" class="emoji" alt=":love_letter:"> (3) Third, relationship prompts.</p>
<p>Why don’t we learn marriage counseling topics until it’s too late?</p>
<p>Consider this question I saw on a forum: “We seem to agree what toxic and dysfunctional families look like. My question is: what is a functional and healthy family supposed to look like? Is there a guide somewhere?”</p>
<p>A lot of replies said things like, “great communication,” “support,” “stability,” or “compromise.” The problem is, these say what to do, but not how to do it. I tried to get specific in LIFE: for example, I now know what the multiple types of support are, and when to use each. Or, what the 4 relationship ruining ways to fight are (stonewalling, contempt, defensiveness, criticism), when they might come up, and what we can do about them. It doesn’t mean I don’t mess up, but it does mean I’m far more aware of actionable ways I can improve.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>I cited all research, something very important to me. The real experts are those researchers in the psychology lab, who over decades have dedicated their lives to studying why we act the way we do. Don’t believe me: believe them. I am simply a mere curator whom I hope does a decent job of scouring, drawing conclusions from, and relating to you their findings in a relatable and insightful way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, my goal is to serve every person, of every culture, who could use more insight into some aspect of their lives. LIFE can be used solo, or among families, teams, companies and schools. It takes two to communicate and our moods often easily affect others.</p>
<p>Today, LIFE helps me stay sane, happy, and healthy as a solo founder. My hope is that if it speaks to you, you can also gain a more fulfilling, purposeful, positive life.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>This is Burak. I am originally from Turkey, and currently living in Berlin. I have studied Computer Science in Istanbul Technical University, and I am currently working as a software engineer at Hellofresh. I am 25 years old, and have been working in the industry since I was 19.</p>
<p>I love building things, and I like challenges; combined these two, it was almost impossible to not get into indie hacking I guess. My latest adventure is Nana, a SaaS starter kit that is focused on getting started with SaaS products super quickly.</p>
<p>I am excited to be a part of the Bootstrapped community, have a nice week!</p>

            <p>Hope everyone is doing well.  My name is Daniel and I’ve been programming for the past 25 years or so.  A few years back my wife and I created a company (Smart Convos, Inc) which creates conversational marketing tools and solutions.</p>
<p>Being a coder most of my life I sometimes find it hard to transition into the business/marketing side of things, so I look forward to interesting discussions and learning more here.  Feel free to message me if you have any questions or need any help as well. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
