It&#39;s even better when those people are have a level of empathy with your daily challenges. This category is for those bootstrappers who want to arrange meet-ups in their locality. </description>

          <title>Looking for bootstrapped enthusiasts to speak at NYC meetup</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[AbbySorensen]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Software Executive Magazine is hosting a one-day event in NYC on August 28 for software companies. The event, Software Executive Forum, will include a panel discussion called “Financing Growth The Smart Way.” We have an opening for 2 more panelists to share their story about bootstrapping a software company.</p>
<p>You can check out the event website at: <a href="https://www.softwareexecutiveforum.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.softwareexecutiveforum.com/</a></p>
<p>Please connect with me on LinkedIn (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbylsorensen/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.linkedin.com/in/abbylsorensen/</a>) or drop me an email at abby.sorensen [at] <a href="http://softwareexecutivemag.com" rel="nofollow noopener">softwareexecutivemag.com</a> if you’re interested in speaking, or if you have any recommendations.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of this panel:<br>
“You’ve decided it’s time to floor the gas pedal towards growth, but you don’t have the cash to do it. What’s next? We all know the tech companies making headlines with eight- and nine-figure VC deals don’t represent the majority of software businesses today. A panel of software CEOs and founders will share realistic strategies for financing growth. They’ll give real examples of resource choices they made along the way to achieving success. You need to hear these real-world examples from your peers about how they said ‘no’ to outside money and ‘yes’ to smart growth.”</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/andycroll">@andycroll</a> and I are organising the 2nd Life. Time. Value Conference in Brighton, England on Wednesday 19th April.</p>
<p>It’s a one day single-track conference in Brighton for 160 people who don’t want to spend their working lives trading time for money.</p>
<p>This year’s LTV Conf speakers (all bootstrapped) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amy Hoy (<a class="mention" href="/u/amyhoy">@amyhoy</a>), Founder <a href="http://letsfreckle.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://letsfreckle.com</a> and <a href="https://unicornfree.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://unicornfree.com/</a>
</li>
<li>Brennan Dunn (<a class="mention" href="/u/brennandunn">@brennandunn</a>) , Founder <a href="http://doubleyourfreelancing.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://doubleyourfreelancing.com</a>
</li>
<li>Bridget Harris, Founder <a href="http://YouCanBook.me" rel="nofollow noopener">http://YouCanBook.me</a>

</li>
<li>Stef Lewandowski, Founder <a href="http://makelight.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://makelight.com</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Early Bird Tickets are on sale until midnight 31st January.</p>
<p>You can grab your ticket here: <a href="http://ti.to/ltvconf/2017" rel="nofollow noopener">http://ti.to/ltvconf/2017</a></p>
<p>We also have a limited number of places to master classes on the 18th April. We’ll have 8 people on a ‘starting’ track working to get their businesses off the ground and well on the way to £10K MRR. And 8 people on a ‘scaling’ track who are working to grow their businesses well beyond £100K MRR.</p>
<p>This conference is inspired by the awesome experiences I’ve had at <a class="mention" href="/u/robwalling">@robwalling</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/marklittlewood">@MarkLittlewood</a>’s conferences but we wanted to do something smaller and closer to home. If you only go to one conference this year, I recommend you go to one of theirs: <a href="http://microconf.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://microconf.com</a> or <a href="http://businessofsoftware.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://businessofsoftware.com</a>. If you can’t make it to either and fancy a trip to the UK’s south coast please do join us.</p>
<p>Hope you can make it,</p>
<p>Jon</p>

We’ve got a conference room booked for Saturday and there will be talks, but the focus is on building relationships (and covering the distance to the next MicroConf Europe <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> )</p>
<p>If you’re interested, check out <a href="http://femtoconf.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://femtoconf.com</a> - there are currently 6 tickets left @ 99 €</p>

            <p>Microconf is here in Barcelona in the next few days. I decided not to go to the conference this year, but as Barcelona is my adopted home city, I’m happy to meetup with anyone from this forum who might be in Barcelona for Microconf.</p>
<p>Let me know if you are interested, and I can try to organise a time/day/place.</p>

          <title>Gold Laces Conference in Oakland on July 23</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[sachinag]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Real-life Bootstrapped Meet-Ups</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I wanted to share Gold Laces Conference with this community.  Gold Laces is a small conference for people interested in side projects and people bootstrapping a business, not just software.</p>
<p>Instead of platitudes and inspiration, Gold Laces is all about the mechanics of bootstrapping. We have lawyers, accountants, marketers, and founders who will tell you exactly what do to, what not to do, and why. You’ll get specific referrals to tools, products, and platforms that can help — all for free or super cheap.</p>
<p>There are lots of strategists and consultants out there who want to charge you hundreds of dollars to just talk about whatever. Instead of doing that, or spending nights and weekends doing research, Gold Laces is one intense day that will tell you exactly what to do, how to do it, and why it works. With early bird tickets at just $99 for a whole day, including lunch and discounts, it’s a way better investment than some quickie online course.</p>
<p>We have a great list of speakers, including:</p>
<p>Chris Liu, Interaction Designer at Mercedes-Benz R&amp;D North America<br>
Elizabeth Yin, Partner at 500 Startups and Co-Founder of HustleCon<br>
Elliott Adams, Startup Next SF Manager and Professor at Hult International Business School<br>
Laura Nelson, Head of Marketing at Broadly<br>
Lindsey Mignano, Neda Shapourian, and Teela Smith, Partners at Smith Shapourian Mignano LLP<br>
Lloyed Lobo, Head of Growth at <a href="http://Speakeasy.co" rel="nofollow noopener">Speakeasy.co</a> and Co-Founder of <a href="http://TractionConf.io" rel="nofollow noopener">TractionConf.io</a><br>
Margot Schmorak, Founder of Hostfully<br>
May Roen, Vice President of Finance at Escalon<br>
Samir Said, 3x bootstrapped founder</p>
<p>So if you’re a bootstrapper, side projecteer, or wanting to start your own thing the right way, please join us for Gold Laces Conference in Oakland on Saturday, July 23.</p>
<p>I can’t link it, but if you Google [gold laces conference] you’ll find all the information.  Thanks!</p>

            <p>I bought one at the early bird price, but probably won’t be able to make it due to some last-minute things that have come up. Since the event is limited to 65 people and is currently sold out, I feel bad taking up a spot if there are people hoping to go!</p>
<p>(BaconBizConf is this Thursday and Friday, May 26-27 in Philadelphia.)</p>

            <p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/bradt">@bradt</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/casjam">@CasJam</a> and I run two conferences that will be opening up registration soon:</p>
<p><a href="http://bigsnowtinyconf.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://bigsnowtinyconf.com</a> (held in Vermont in Jan 2016)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><a href="http://bigsnowtinyconfwest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://bigsnowtinyconfwest.com</a> (held in Colorado in Feb 2016)</p>
<p>Each conference will have only a few spots (thus the “tiny conf” moniker) so if you think you want to go, be sure to get on the mailing list(s) for the right one for you.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!<br>

            <p>I am organizing a regular meetup in Swindon (UK) for people who are  running (or are interested in running) their own bootstrapped software product business. Come along and talk shop with other aspiring and experienced bootstrappers. It doesn’t matter if you  are developing for web, Windows, Mac or mobile.</p>
<p>The first meetup is at a pub on the evening of Tuesday 16th June 2015. You can find out more and RSVP at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/South-West-Bootstrappers/">http://www.meetup.com/South-West-Bootstrappers/</a> . If any of you are within reach, I would be great to see you there!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m going to be in Boulder from the 9th through the 19th, hoping to visit some events at ‘startup week’, as well as interview with a variety of companies.</p>
<p>If anyone’s in the area or going to be at startup week, it’d be fun to meet.</p>
<p>What with the housing prices, I’m getting the impression that Boulder is probably not the best place to bootstrap a company, but it’s where we’re headed, for a variety of reasons.</p>

            <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>About a week ago I received an e-mail from Amy Hoy advising that they’re holding BaconBizConf on the 28th/29th May in Philadelphia. Anybody been before? Would love to hear how you got on with it as I’m seriously considering attending this year. It would be great to hear from people who have attended previous years.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Simon</p>
