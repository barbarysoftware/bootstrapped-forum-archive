            <p>I discovered <a href="https://sockratescustom.com/">Sockrates</a> a few weeks ago, it looks like a fun way to send a gift to your customers or in a tradeshow. They seems to work with big companies like Dell.</p>
<p>Did you tried this kind of gift already? I’m curious of the “ROI” of it</p>

            <p>Hi all, sorry to be joining you at the last minute! We are a New Zealand company wanting to start selling a desktop B2B software product. As this is an old-skool downloaded item and most providers now seem to be expecting SaaS, we would really appreciate any recommendations for providers who can still deal with software downloads. Many thanks!</p>

          <title>Future of the Bootstrapped community forum</title>

            <p>TLDR:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>On July 24, 2021 this community will enter “read-only” mode.</li>
<li>On or after August 24, 2021, this community will go offline.</li>
<li><strong>The <a href="https://bootstrapped.fm/">Bootstrapped podcast</a> will continue</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I took over the running of this community two and a half years ago, when it had already been in decline for some time. I tried to breath some new life into the community, but it has proven to be difficult.</p>
<p>There’s a solid amount of daily traffic, but few people contribute new topics for discussion. We’re a prime example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)">the 90/9/1 rule</a>.</p>

<em>Bootstrapped community pageviews for the last 12 months</em></p>
<p>Running the community uses my time and money on an ongoing basis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosting the Discourse software costs $100/month. Self-hosting is a free-ish alternative but would require more time, and something I’m not interested in doing.</li>
<li>There’s a steady flow of spammy postings that need to be deleted or, rarely, allowed through. The Discourse software does do a great job of auto-detecting these.</li>
</ul>
<p>In recent months I’ve spent time participating in similar communities to see what they do differently. What I’ve found is:</p>
<ul>
<li>in 2021, many online communities struggle to maintain a decent level of participation</li>
<li>successful communities often have one or more paid employees (eg. IndieHackers has 2 or 3 full-time employees and the financial backing of Stripe, who own it).</li>
<li>paid communities have more open sharing</li>
<li>tiny private groups (eg. a 10- to 20- person Slack group) work well for creating a strong sense of community, solidarity, and mutual help,</li>
<li>For me, Twitter is better than the Bootstrapped community for asking questions when I need advice for a specific business problem</li>
</ul>
<p>I considered approaching relevant companies (eg Paddle) to see if I could get some decent sponsorship of the community, thus allowing me to hire a part-time community manager. But  this would be a form of sales. I’m busy enough doing sales for my own company, and don’t have the motivation to do for this community too.</p>
<p>The rough plan for closing down (still open to change):</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll leave this topic (the one you’re reading right now) open for discussion for a while.</li>
<li>In about a month, I’ll switch the forum to read-only mode.</li>
<li>In about two months, I’ll close down the forum altogether.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a decision I’ve reached easily. I’ve been contemplating this for six months.</p>
<p><strong>I’m open to alternative solutions and ideas!</strong> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Recommended alternative communities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indie Hackers</a> if you are just getting started and want to chat with others just getting started</li>
<li>
<a href="https://foundersummit.co/">Founder Summit</a> (paid) if your business is viable and you like to run a calm company</li>
<li>
<a href="https://microconf.com/microconf-connect">MicroConf Connect</a> “a space for founders and their teams of independently funded startups to connect with like minded individuals.”</li>
<li>
<a href="https://megamaker.co/">MegaMaker</a> - A paid community for bootstrappers</li>
<li>Find 10 or so people at a similar stage in your businesses and make a private Slack account.</li>

            <p>I am interesting in options for flipping (selling) a Saas business. My main caveat is I don’t want someone that will just want to screw it over to extract money and disappoint the current users who are small business owners. There are two part time employee’s who preferably would stay on board (in Australia).</p>
<p>Health reasons make it difficult for me and I have other on going stuff as well.</p>
<p>What is the best place to look to find a conscientious buyer?</p>

          <title>Tips on Software Download, Review and Listing Pages</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[james_9090]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Discussions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m currently working on posting my new desktop program in software listing pages. I want to get backlinks, user reviews and some traffic.</p>
<p>Any advice? I see that listing pages can put pressure on software publishers:</p>
<ul>
<li>By NOT moderating user reviews, or doing so in their favour.</li>
<li>By writing and publishing themselves competitor’s pages, which are obviously unclaimed, but they can link those pages to your page.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a good list of the major Software List sites. I’m open to share it, just DM me. Some are exclusively for B2B, there are lots of management software listings for any sector you imagine! Although, most are quite open to any software category and also allow B2C.</p>
<p>A different, but related question: Anyone here using <a href="https://appvisor.com/pad">PAD files</a>? They contain the basic info of your software so you can send you software specs faster, in an easy and standard way. I see they’re still a thing. Yet, they look old, outdated and clumsy as hell, but many pages still use them.</p>
<p>Also, for people using listing pages, do they make a substatial traffic/lead generation contribution for you?</p>

            <p>We have a B2B product that sells for around $100/mth. We have a company that is looking to whitelabel and sell the software as part of their professional services they sell to the same industry (tattooist). They will perform sales (tradeshows) and first level support.</p>
<p>We are just considering various pricing models.</p>
<ol>
<li>We pay them commission 20% for the life of the product.</li>
<li>They pay retail and markup price.</li>
</ol>
<p>Something else??</p>
<p>Does anyone have real world experience with something like this?</p>

          <title>How to start an affiliate program with a Stripe hosted checkout?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Content_Koala]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Discussions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Our checkout at Content Koala is a very simple Stripe hosted checkout.</p>
<p>Our business could really benefit from an affiliate program. However, I can only find a way to do this for WooCommerce or full Stripe integration via partners. No simple way of doing it for a hosted Stripe Checkout.</p>
<p>I am guessing that there may be a solution that involves unique link generation and simply tracking those via my Google Analytics?</p>
<p>But if any of you have an elegant solution that would be great <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>April seems late for a yearly report. But April 1st marks one year since I acquired Saber Feedback. So actually the report is quite timely. In that time we've had five major achievements and two significant challenges.</p>

          <title>Anyone here using PayMate?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Paul1970]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Discussions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Regarding the issue of FastSpring going downhill (see other threads here), I’m Australian and just noticed PayMate today:</p>
<p><a href="https://global.paymate.com/pricing-online-moto-australian-fees/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://global.paymate.com/pricing-online-moto-australian-fees/</a></p>
<p>It appears they only take a flat 2.60% from each sale (for Aussies), with same or next day payment direct to my bank account. This is way better than PayPal (which I use), so I was wondering if anyone has any experience with them? It also means I can escape any PayPal disputes (which fraudulent customers love to do!) and also not pay any PayPal fees to get my money.</p>
<p>They also handle international payments, too (with an extra 2.75% conversion fee).</p>

            <p>I have a standard 99.99% uptime SLA for all “enterprise” customers — no term negotiations. Currently, I don’t offer an SLA for non-enterprise customers. For the enterprise SLA, I’m doing a variable 2–10x multiple on their subscription price, depending on projected volume. Minimum contract is $999/yr. But the more conversations I’ve had this year around SLAs, the more I feel I’m selling myself short here pricing-wise. Thoughts? What do you charge for an enterprise SLA?</p>

          <title>Hiring: Freelance Java coder for Feature Upvote (Remote, part-time)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[SteveMcLeod]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Discussions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hey all, I’m looking for a Java dev for 1 day/week.</p>
<p><strong>I offer flexibility and low-stress work.</strong></p>
<p>This would suit someone easing back into work after an extended parental leave break.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you are bootstrapping your own product and would like to have some extra income.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://featureupvote.com/jobs/">job ad is here</a>, but I’ll copy and paste below.</p>
<h2>Position: Freelance Java coder</h2>
<p><a href="https://featureupvote.com/">Feature Upvote</a> helps product managers track feature requests. It is a SaaS, built as a traditional multi-page web application.</p>
<p>We’re self-funded, profitable, and sustainable. When you work with us, you get a stable and predictable long-running engagement, in a low-stress environment.</p>
<h3>About the engagement:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Initially 1 day/week (32-40 hours/month), with occasional additional days according to our needs</li>
<li>6 month engagement, moving to an ongoing commitment if both sides are happy with the initial engagement</li>
<li>Fully remote</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a chance of increasing the monthly hours in the future, but this is not something we can promise.</p>
<p>The current Java code was written by the founder over the last four years. There’s some technical debt.</p>
<h3>Things you’ll do:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Regularly update dependencies</li>
<li>Fix bugs</li>
<li>Code new features and improve existing features</li>
<li>Clean up the dozens of “TODO”s in the current code base. I did say there was some technical debt!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our tech stack:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Java 8 - although perhaps with your help we’ll move to Java 11 soon</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>Redis</li>
<li>Spark - a lightweight Java web framework</li>
<li>Freemarker</li>
<li>Jdbi</li>
<li>A light scattering of JavaScript</li>
<li>AWS - for hosting</li>
<li>Maven - for building and dependency management</li>
</ul>
<p>The two skills you need expertise in are <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong> . Everything else is a nice-to-have, and can be picked up on the job.</p>
<h3>Tools we use:</h3>
<ul>
<li>GitHub - for version control</li>
<li>Jira - issue tracking and product management</li>
<li>Slack - because sometimes synchronous communication is necessary</li>
<li>Email - the preferred way to communicate</li>
<li>Notion - for internal docs</li>
</ul>
<h3>About us:</h3>
<p>We’re a tiny, fully remote team, mostly in Europe. Our company is based in Barcelona.</p>
<p>The founder of Feature Upvote hosts the <a href="https://bootstrapped.fm/">Bootstrapped podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Feature Upvote’s first line of code was written in November 2016, and we launched in May 2017.</p>
<p>Our attitude:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep things simple: this goes for our product, our processes, and our code base</li>
<li>work in a low-stress environment: our ambition is modest, so we don’t sacrifice our health, life, or relationships for our work. We get our work done, but without unrealistic, strict deadlines and without undue pressure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>About you:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You are smart and get things done.</li>
<li>You speak excellent English.</li>
<li>You have solid experience in Java and MySQL.</li>
<li>You are able to demonstrate past work.</li>
<li>The time zone where you live is within +/- two hours of Central European Standard Time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The hiring process:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Applications close 31st March, 2021</strong></li>
<li>If you meet our shortlist, we’ll write to you by 7th April, 2021 with some basic technical questions. You’ll have a week to answer. It should take you an hour max to complete these questions.</li>
<li>If the answers are good, we’ll schedule a Zoom meeting.</li>
<li>We’ll make a decision shortly after the meeting and let you know one way or another.</li>
<li>Once we have an agreement, we’ll be ready for you to start immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to apply:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Apply via email to <a href="mailto:steve@featureupvote.com">steve@featureupvote.com</a>
</li>
<li>The email subject line should read: “Application for freelance Java coder position”</li>
<li>Include your CV. It should show significant experience in Java and MySQL</li>
<li>State your expected hourly rate and availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m looking forward to hearing from you!</p>

          <title>How to get product feedback from our community</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[SteveMcLeod]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Discussions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><strong>Rule 1: Don’t be a fly-by poster.</strong></p>
<p>It is the only rule, actually.</p>
<p>A fly-by poster creates an account, posts a self-promoting post, doesn’t interact with any other posts, and typically doesn’t even bother coming back.</p>
<p>It is slightly annoying but also an ineffective way to use our community.</p>
<p>These posts typically get deleted or unlisted by the community mods.</p>
<p><strong>A better way to use our community to promote yourself</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign up, and read a few posts to get a feel for our community’s style.</li>
<li>Write some helpful comments on existing posts. Build up a reputation over time as knowledgeable and helpful.</li>
<li>Only then should you write your self-promoting post.</li>
<li>Interact with every comment you get - always in a polite way: eg. “Thanks for the feedback.”, “That’s interesting, I’ll consider that.”</li>
<li>Continue to comment on other posts.</li>
<li>Post an update on your own post.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, this takes a long time and some commitment. The difference though, is that it actually works. Not just on this community, but on online communities in general.</p>
<p>Fly-by posting by newcomers simply doesn’t work as a way of promoting oneself.</p>

Right now we are using webflow and I cannot load an exe in their tool.</p>

            <p>Hi all!</p>
<p>I’m proud to say that Product Fruits really nailed it. It looks we are adressing the problem which most SAAS has today - we focus on increasing conversions from free trial users to paying customers in the app.</p>
<p>Today a common problem is, that 80% of the users (or even more), that try an app for the first time, won’t end up converting to paying customers, which is totally crazy.</p>
<p>Let me know if you want to know more about Productfruits (can’t insert the link as I’m newbie)</p>

          <title>Shrink-wrap software - purchaser license agreement</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[theallan]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Wondering if anyone else has encountered something similar to this (just had it happen for the second time in 10+ years of trading): I sell shrink wrapped software that can be bought and downloaded with a simple credit card form. It has an EULA the purchaser must accept if they want to purchase and download the software.</p>
<p>Now a large financial company has indicated they wish to buy a license, but I need to agree to their 19 page license agreement, in addition to them agreeing to my own EULA.</p>
<p>I’ve pushed back saying that I can have a lawyer check it and our price will reflect that, plus any extra work needed on our part for extra obligations under their license.</p>
<p>Has this happened to anyone else? I’m really curious as to what large companies like Microsoft or Adobe would do when presented with something like this as well. Laugh at them I suspect.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m a new member and this is my first post.</p>
<p>I’m the developer/founder of a tool that like many other businesses uses an array of services for email, SMS to database, and hosting.  I’ve heard that those rates can be negotiated, has anyone had success negotiating their rates?  Or does anyone have someone they can recommend that will help me negotiate my rates down?</p>

            <p>In some web apps they are able to show the users photo when they login. What is the best way to do that? Is it <a href="https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/" class="inline-onebox">Gravatar - Globally Recognized Avatars</a> or are there other services that can do it?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Any help would be great. I have a chrome based browser and would like to offer a free 1 month trial then charge yearly. I was looking at Paddle but I don’t think they will work because I want to offer a no credit card free trial. I also don’t have users or a server that would communicate or integrate with these services.</p>
<p>Anyone else find a simple solution to this problem?</p>

          <title>Stripe fees in Europe</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[jwr]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Discussions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I use Braintree for credit card processing, and over the years I’ve been frustrated by lots of things there. I thought I’d migrate to Stripe, which supposedly was way better.</p>
<p>Well, I just shelved this project.</p>
<p>It turned out that payouts in EUR are fine, but payouts in USD are only possible to a USD account… in the United States. And it’s not possible to have a bank account in the US without having presence there. My SaaS offers pricing in EUR, USD and PLN and I really wanted to process those three currencies, like I do with Braintree today.</p>
<p>But, I thought to myself, I could perhaps live with a conversion from USD to EUR… and then I looked at the fee structure. There is an additional 2% charge for currency conversion, so overall the fees would be: 2.9% international payments, 2% currency conversion, 0.5% Stripe billing. I’m not sure how these percentages are calculated, but they add up to about <strong>5.4%</strong> of posted prices!</p>
<p>I checked my last statement, and Braintree currently charges me nearly 3.1% on USD transactions. I don’t know why it’s 3.1% and not 2.9% which they advertise, but I guess that’s how things go.</p>
<p>I tried to find a justification for paying 5.4% and I couldn’t. Sure, I have a lot of problems with Braintree, but I guess I can live with the inconvenience for that much money. Also, most of Stripe “value added” features in Billing are useless for me anyway (invoices are issued in US-centric “speculative” way <em>before</em> the customer is successfully charged, no SAF-T export, insistence on phone numbers in all E-mails, forced formatting of E-mails).</p>
<p>I’d be interested to hear what others in the EU think — if you have a SaaS business, do you use Stripe? Do you just accept a 5.4% commission?</p>

          <title>Brexit and the new &quot;XI&quot; EU VAT prefix</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I just learned about the new “XI” EU VAT prefix for Northern Ireland and I’ve been wondering — what do you do about GB customers? Do you contact all of them to find out which ones are in Northern Ireland and ask them to update their VAT numbers with you? Do you just ignore the problem (and risk trouble with your local tax office later)?</p>
<p>It seems that GB numbers can no longer be validated via the EU VIES system, so there is no way to verify if your B2B customer is indeed VAT-registered in the EU.</p>

          <title>Looking for feedback - Frustration Free Online Teaching &amp; Training</title>

            <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Teaching online is very difficult. Are students paying attention? Have they grasped concepts or sleeping at leisure? These queries take a toll on tutors.</p>
<p>Multiple apps are literally overkill for 30 minutes class. One app for scheduling. Different communication app to reminder. Email or phone to share assignment &amp; results. Jamboard for white-boarding. Manually reminder to even pay attention.</p>
<p>This exercise makes mental tall on teachers. We’ve built Standupmeet for teaching and training.</p>
<p><strong>Collaborative Whiteboard:</strong><br>
Super easy to draw objects. Showcase any documents on whiteboard.</p>
<p><strong>Cohort Based Education:</strong><br>
Implement true peer learning with Standupmeet. Create multiple study zones and divide students.</p>
<p><strong>Take Instant Quiz or Poll:</strong><br>
Are students paying attention? Have they grasped concept. Take instant quiz and learn where students are in learning.</p>
<p><strong>Integrated Library &amp; Assignments</strong><br>
I don’t need to force students to use Google Drive or dropbox. During classes only, they can upload assignments in library.</p>
<p>Share Screen, Video Conferencing<br>
You don’t need to use different apps for sharing screen or video conference.</p>
<p>Standupmeet is now live. Signup for free now and share your feedback.</p>
