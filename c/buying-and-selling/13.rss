          <title>Is it okay to increase the subscription renewal price for existing customers?</title>

            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I am not sure of the normal practice. I have a product based on subscription and the renewal fee is $14.95 per year.</p>
<p>If I wish to increase it to $19.95, will it be applicable to only new customers or can I increase it for existing customers? Or is it wrong to increase the price for existing customers?</p>
<p>I haven’t specified anything regarding price increase in service terms &amp; conditions, yet.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Gautam Jain</p>

          <title>Would You Buy This Software?</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi All - I have a question for you wonderful/smart folks. I am not a developer, so I apologize for any dumb shit I might be saying here, but I really appreciate your help &amp; input in advance.</p>
<p>So somehow I ended up building out a “functioning” software/website that caters to a certain industry by using bubble.is (It’s pretty much like a WIX website builder but on massive steroids).</p>
<p>The software/website is still pre-revenue, but through my network, I am starting to get some interest from institutions &amp; large companies in the space who might be interested in purchasing the software.</p>
<p>BUT, as mentioned, the software/website purely built/hosted on bubble’s platform. If I sold it, I doubt there would be any type of transfer of source code, but rather just hand off my bubble’s login.</p>
<p>So would a large company even bother purchasing this type of software built on a third party platform? I have a demo coming up with a company, but I am deathly scared of telling them that it’s built on bubble. I have no idea what I am doing. I’d really really appreciate your guys’ insights. Thank you!</p>
<p>EDIT: I mean selling as in selling the whole software/company to another company (acquisition opportunity).</p>

          <title>Does invoicing reduce fraudulent sales?</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I sell through PayPal, and in the past couple of years I’ve had 5 fraudulent sales (ie. the owner of the PayPal account disputed the sale by saying they didn’t authorise it).</p>
<p>The other day I saw PayPal’s Business app in Apple’s App Store, where it lets you invoice users for their purchase. After playing with it for a bit, it seems to me like it has the potential to reduce fraud, as you collect payment before the user gets their license for your product? So in the case of those 5 users, they would dispute the invoice without parting with their money first? And thus stop me sending a license key for no reason?</p>
<p>Am I right in thinking like this? That is: it’s better to go from taking their money and fixing the problem later, to fixing the problem first before taking any money.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

          <title>Is PayPal unprofessional for B2B?</title>

            <p>Scenario: I’m about to launch soon with software for being sold business to business. I have both PayPal and FastSpring accounts. I’m tossing up whether I just use PayPal on my website, or if I should solely use FastSpring with credit cards and purchase orders, and other payment methods; but without PayPal being an option.</p>
<p>I’m leaning towards FastSpring for this, as it seems to me to be the more professional approach. But two issues bother me: I’m Australian, and they don’t accept AUD only (I have to sell in USD too); and to get my payments from them I have to transfer it to my PayPal account, which means I lose money on their commission, and then again lose commission when withdrawing the money from PayPal.</p>
<p>With PayPal alone, I can advertise in AUD only and only have one commission to bear. But what’s the perception of PayPal when it comes to businesses (and sole proprietors, etc) buying? Does it make me look amateur?</p>
<p>In other words, has anyone here used PayPal only for B2B, and did it cause any issues from your buyers?</p>

          <title>Selling some Domain Names - too ambitious?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[DLJ]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Buying &amp; Selling</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I’m slowly weeding out domain names in my portfolio that I’m just not going to use and wondered if anyone here has had success selling names for 4 and 5 figures.</p>
<p>I’ve started with</p>
<p><a href="http://search4adomain.com" rel="nofollow noopener">search4adomain.com</a>, <a href="http://search4adomainname.com" rel="nofollow noopener">search4adomainname.com</a> and <a href="http://search4aname.com" rel="nofollow noopener">search4aname.com</a> for about $1500 asking price on flippa (for the bundle of 3)</p>
<p><a href="http://splittracker.com" rel="nofollow noopener">splittracker.com</a>, <a href="http://split-tracker.com" rel="nofollow noopener">split-tracker.com</a> and <a href="http://splitracker.com" rel="nofollow noopener">splitracker.com</a> are bundled up for $10k and up</p>
<p>some other ones I have are things like <a href="http://search4aroom.com" rel="nofollow noopener">search4aroom.com</a>, <a href="http://onlinekeywords.com" rel="nofollow noopener">onlinekeywords.com</a>, <a href="http://opinionadvisor.com" rel="nofollow noopener">opinionadvisor.com</a>, <a href="http://opinioncrawler.com" rel="nofollow noopener">opinioncrawler.com</a>, <a href="http://search4words.com" rel="nofollow noopener">search4words.com</a>, <a href="http://search4keywords.com" rel="nofollow noopener">search4keywords.com</a> etc.</p>
<p>flippa links purposefully omitted as I’m not trying to hype or advertise, I’m looking for folks in the know</p>
<p>what do you all think? too ambitious?</p>
<p>I’ve not been one for trading in domain names so have no idea really. Now I’ve ‘grown up’ regarding what I could possibly build (in terms of time/commitment and passion) I’m starting to offload.</p>
<p>All opinions and thoughts appreciated (<a class="mention" href="/u/ian">@ian</a> would love your input on this)</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I’ve started a social media tracking SaaS app a year ago, but unfortunately didn’t had the time to promote it, except for the Clickbank affiliate network which is used currently as a payment provider for the application (Can be switched to Fastspring with minimum amount of work). The web address is <a href="https://www.listen6.com" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.listen6.com</a>. The programming tools used are PHP (Yii2 framework), MySQL. Asking price is $2500.</p>
