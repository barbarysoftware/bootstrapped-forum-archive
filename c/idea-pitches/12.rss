          <title>SMS greeting cards - Schedule SMS for important events</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I was thinking about how I usually forget about someone’s bday or anniversary or such more important occasions. If there isn’t for Facebook I wouldn’t remember it all, unless I create a reminder on my phone.</p>
<p>How about a website or an app where people could order SMS greetings such as and subscribe to it annually.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if my friend Anna has a birthday I would write personalised SMS which will be sent every year on her birthday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if I’m a parent I might want to order some cool text from Santa Clause or some fictional character like Spiderman I can get it here and my kid will get that text message from fictional character</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem here would be that the other person would get an SMS from unknown phone number.</p>

          <title># Messaging app where communication is done only via push notifications</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[dadili]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Idea Pitches</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I came up with idea to build messaging app that would only use push notifications to message each other. You know that you are able to reply back to people directly from push notification like this <a href="https://imgur.com/a/B3bSQXs">https://imgur.com/a/B3bSQXs</a></p>
<p>iOS supports text, images, videos and audio on push notifications. In that way you don’t even have to leave your Lock Screen to message other people. I don’t think that most messaging apps utilize full potential of rich push notification. This app would focus only on messaging via push notifications, so the concept/mindset would be completely different from, you would be “forced” to communicate via push notifications which might bring totally different experience</p>
<p>I’d like to build an app that will have only 2 screens. One for login and registration and one for typing a message and choosing whom to send it to.</p>
<p>What do you think about it?</p>

          <title>My idea: scripting engine for embedded systems</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[ngoncalves]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Idea Pitches</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>My product is a virtual machine (VM) for embedded systems (think Arduino or mbed) and<br>
the respective compiler suite. It enables a faster development cycle, simplifies<br>
remote management and adds support for scripting.</p>
<p>The potential customers are companies in IoT, smart metering, transportation, robotics<br>
and industrial automation. These form a quite diverse set, but nonetheless share common<br>
pain points: long development cycles, products are hard to maintain, even harder to debug<br>
in the field, and their firmware rarely is updated.</p>
<p>The VM, I plan to distribute as an open source library with a dual license, GPL v3 and<br>
commercial. The latter allows customers to integrate the VM in their products without<br>
having to release their source code.</p>
<p>The compiler, on the other hand is closed source, and has an evaluation period after<br>
which a user license is required. Since the compiler is required to use the VM, I am<br>
assuming that customers who see value in using the VM, will buy compiler licenses even<br>
if they are also opening their source code</p>
<p>I know that:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am trying to sell to technically minded customers</li>
<li>Part of the product is open source</li>
</ol>
<p>As for 1), I suspect it will be hard but this is the area I work in, and that gives me confidence about the value the product is bringing.</p>
<p>And for 2), I am using open source as a way to distribute and market the product. For the potential customers I am considering, the alternative is to do in-person demos and sales. Which is not feasible for me (too expensive, too risky).</p>
<p>That being said, I would like to have your comments on the idea.</p>

            <p>Am I the only one on the planet thinking a new “Request [Paid] Service” button on GitHub to send requests for help to all interested/signed-up parties would generate a lot of $$$ for open source, for developers and for Microsoft AND would help users of open source too?</p>
<p>Way more valuable than Facebook’s “invention” of the “Like” button in my opinion!</p>

            <p>Hello, bootstrappers<br>
Now we are creating an integration platform like Zapier. But it will be free for end users. Also we want to create a product directory where vendors can be listing. Vendors can buy ads or get users via affiliate program. Our product is Free Zapier and Capterra MIX</p>
<p>What can you say about our idea? What problem do you have with Google ads, Capterra and G2?</p>
<p>What problems your users have in integrations?</p>

            <p>Hey bootstrappers,</p>
<p>I just created a landing page for my new project that has the goal to bring together especially SAAS businesses with potential costumers or in other words to generate highly targeted leads by providing beautiful courses.</p>
<p>I have already posted some weeks ago in this forum and could talk to some interesting people since then who helped me to sharpen my idea. So again, since I am a good programmer, but not so good copywriter, I need your help.</p>
<p>Do you have any wishes or feedback? How can I improve this landing page?</p>

          <title>Critique idea: An desktop app to help clean up email inbox</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[izlesa]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Idea Pitches</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hey!</p>
<p>The problem:<br>
Some time ago I was overwhelmed with unread emails in my Gmail inbox. Mostly, they were newsletters, which I had no time to read. They piled up and I started to lose important emails in between them. At the time, there were more than 7000 unread emails. I tried to clean it up manually but it was very boring and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Guess <span class="hashtag">#1</span><br>
Grouping emails and deleting them in a bulk will extremely improve speed of inbox cleaning. Basically, I solved my problem with existing inbox cleaner in form of SaaS with a subscription plan (100$ per year for 5 mail accounts, cheapest service is about 60$ per year for 3 accounts).</p>
<p>Guess <span class="hashtag">#2</span><br>
Because inbox cleaning needed only few times per year, subscription model is very strange for customers.</p>
<p>Guess <span class="hashtag">#3</span><br>
After <a href="http://unroll.me" rel="nofollow noopener">unroll.me</a> scandal many peoples, who used it, now think about privacy issues.</p>
<p>So, desktop app can cover all free points.</p>
<p>I built the small prototype. It’s very basic and just group emails by a sender with corresponding statistic and ability to move to trash whole group:</p>
            <div class="onebox imgur-album">
              <a href="https://imgur.com/a/fEYsA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">
                <span class="outer-box" style="width:600px">
                  <span class="inner-box">
                    <span class="album-title">[Album] Imgur: The magic of the Internet</span>
                  </span>
                </span>
                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9z5XYHX.jpg?fb" title="Imgur: The magic of the Internet" height="315" width="600">
              </a>
            </div>

<p>So, some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think about this idea?</li>
<li>Do you have this kind of problems with your emails?</li>
<li>Did you use some online cleaners/unsubscribers like Mailstrom, Unenroll or CleanEmail?</li>
<li>What should I do next? Just replicate competitors features or try to find early users with existing basic prototype? Should I charge them to validate idea or just reiterate on their feedback till value will be bigger.</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you have or had same problems, please contact me here or via PM =)</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback!</p>

          <title>Bootstrapped &amp; Indie Hackers News for Asia</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Greeting,</p>
<p>I have an idea to create something similar with TechInAsia or e27––a media platform that focus to bring Startup news in Asia––but I hate “Startup” world, so we will create a media platform that focus to bring a news about Bootstrapped business, Indie Hackers, and some technology.</p>
<p>Why it’s only for “Asia”? Because I live at Asia. And I think community like this–a Bootstrapped Company, Indie Hackers/Makers, etc–is so few. Or… Didn’t so famous? Or… Everyone is only interesting with Startup world? Get funding, sold company, get nothing profit, shutdown.</p>
<p>Let me know if you interesting with this idea, and what do you think about this idea? Thank you very much <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Have a nice day! (It’s night here, btw)</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Fariz Rizaldy</p>

          <title>Idea Validation: Is this an annoying problem that is worth solving?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[amirathi]]></dc:creator>

            <p>Along with your response if you can mention city/country you are reporting from that would be great.</p>
<p>Short version:<br>
Once in a while do you have to call customer care number of insurance company, bank, Internet Service Provider, Cellular operator etc.? Do you have to go through annoying IVR and being on hold forever until you can talk to a real person? Does this feel like waste of your time?</p>
<p>Regular version:<br>
Most people have to interact with at least one company in each of the following categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet Service Provider (ISP)</li>
<li>Cellular Network Provider</li>
<li>Cable TV operator</li>
<li>Bank</li>
<li>Insurance company</li>
</ul>
<p>These interactions include information/clarification or service requests of some kind. E.g. billing inquiry, change of plan/scheme, renewals. Every time I need to talk to these providers I go through this cycle:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find customer support number of the company on google</li>
<li>Retrieve the identification information (account/policy/registration number) from their website/ TV/ Checkbook/Insurance policy</li>
<li>Call up the customer support and hoop through various menu of annoying IVR, optionally key in the identification somewhere in there.</li>
<li>Hold the line, “your call is important to us …blah blah blah…”</li>
<li>Talk to a real person (customer service rep) who probably asks you the same identification again. Wait while he pulls up your account.</li>
<li>You explain what you are calling about. He puts you on hold while he digs for relevant details.</li>
<li>At this point, if you are lucky your query gets answered. Otherwise some more rounds of hold/unhold follows until he/she finally finds what you want.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this is really inefficient, boring and costs me anywhere between 10 to 30 minutes of my life. For companies that customer service time is cost, literally. Do you think this is a problem worth solving?</p>

            <p>This is a pre-lunch page. Except for this, nothing has been done yet.</p>

<p>I deliberately didn’t use the landing page template, because I wanted to start out on a very small scale, but those seem too pro-pretend and feel vanity. (I’m also tired of the photos of people smiling at the laptop.)</p>
<p>I thought that it was a challenge to make the description detailed while maintaining the page very light and simple,  and I think I did it somehow.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any feedback you give me.</p>

          <title>A new technology that allows much better voice quality for mobile audio calling Apps</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[temp851]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Idea Pitches</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I created a proof of concept audio calling mobile app which provides much better voice quality under bad network conditions than most existing Apps (Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, etc.). It is demonstrably much better than what exists today and fixes those annoying metallic noises you hear when your WiFi connection is bad and you cannot hear your peer properly. With my codec the voice stays almost crystal clear and the other performance characteristics are still very good (low latency, bandwidth used, etc).</p>
<p>The question is what next? I have a pretty busy day job and created this on my spare time on weekends. Now I need to decide what my next steps are.</p>
<p>Some of the options I have:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Build a production audio calling App and release it. This requires funding, team, time and infrastructure and I will need to quit my job. Cons: I have no idea how to monetize yet another audio/video calling app (and the world probably doesn’t really need another one).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to license the technology to existing App vendors. One problem is I don’t know anyone from these companies and don’t know who to approach (likely solvable, I can search my network). Probably need to patent the technology first otherwise not sure I can sell anything; the idea and implementation are not rocket science and if not patented can be re-implemented from clean sheet. I hate software patents but don’t know if I will have any negotiating lever with Big Co without one. Another problem is I have no idea if anyone will want to license what I created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open-source the technology. Unfortunately doesn’t pay the bills. Plus what I have is just a proof of concept, not a production ready library so I will need to spend even more time on this without being paid anything. This may be my last resort if I don’t find a good way to monetize or build a business on this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something else?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What would you do?</p>

            <p>The problem: cryptocurrency news aggregators do not filter content they deliver.</p>
<p>The idea is to build a manually curated cryptocurrencies news catalog which will deliver valuable content only. The content value will be metered by its origin (official source or not) and social performance.</p>

          <title>Idea to help digital consultants</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[chrisj]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Idea Pitches</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p><strong>Back story</strong><br>
We run a web agency and have a couple of SaaS side projects. Recently we started looking at how we could make our agency work more efficient, so we could have more time to focus on the SaaS stuff.</p>
<p>One thing that we have always struggled with is managing work requests from clients. Random emails and phone calls asking for updates or changes were just creating so much noise and effort. We have to go back and clarify the requirements, we then create and send over a change proposal, then we send an invoice, then finally add it as a ticket to our support system once it is paid.</p>
<p>So we started optimizing the process by creating standard scope documents for common requests (add mail box, add new page to website etc.). This has improved things, but what really made a difference was putting the whole thing into one of our SaaS products, <a href="http://clientform.io" rel="nofollow noopener">clientform.io</a>. We basically use the system to define scope, capture the details we need and collect payment. It’s not what the product is intended for (it’s actually for therapists to go paperless). So we are branching clientform and pivoting.</p>
<p><strong>Idea</strong><br>
Our vision is to create a product that essentially allows a consulting service or agency to have a SaaSy feel by creating a Service Portal. This is a space to manage client subscriptions &amp; work requests. It also takes care of the hygiene aspects of a SaaS like, billing, dunning, invoicing, billing history, forgotten pw etc. By abstracting the process away from unstructured email or calls, we aim to make everything way more efficient for everybody including the client.</p>
<p>The other use case we can see is for bootrappeers to create a Wizard of Oz type service as part of idea validation. You can have a portal for clients to register, pay a subscription and manage their account without having an actual app delivering the service - you do this manually until you prove off that there is a market.</p>
<p>One thing we don’t want to do is get involved in task management. There are a ton of very good options already out there. This is much more about having an online service shop and a my account area for clients.</p>
<p>Anybody running a consultancy think this is something you would want to use &amp; pay for?</p>
<p>Any feedback much appreciated.</p>

            <p>a monitoring tool for AWS, which:</p>
<ul>
<li>shows inventory across <strong>multiple accounts</strong> (inventory = EC2 instances and other resources)</li>
<li>groups inventory by tags (tag = environment)</li>
<li>shows basic metrics for the instance (usage, bandwidth, etc)</li>
<li>shows billing details across multiple accounts in dynamic (last month, current month, next month, projection for full year)</li>
<li>a bunch of bells and whistles such as notifications, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>?</p>
<p>There is a single dashboard displaying everything above.</p>
<p>The tool can be installed on-premise if needed.</p>
<p>The key here is a fixed pricing model (3 tiers). Similar tools charge $15 per EC2 instance per month, and a little less for managed resources, such as RDS, ELB, etc. Amazon Cloud Watch is (mostly) free but it does not aggregate inventory and billing across multiple accounts in a single dashboard.</p>
<p>We have developed tool internally to manage AWS inventory for one of our client’s (10 accounts, 300 active instances) and it is saving them ~ 100K a year.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I think I found a problem which can be automated and solved with SaaS.<br>
But I am having hard time to verify market and find someone who has this problem.</p>
<p>There are a lot of industries where excel files used a lot and because of format mismatch a lot of manual labor spent to reformat such files.<br>
For instance, supplier receives product catalogs from manufactors, but these catalogs can have different column names, unit of measure etc. Supplier spends time to have similar data in the db doing manual edit. Also, it is error prone.<br>
I think automated converter (with proper mappings setuped) will save a lot of time and money for such companies.</p>
<p>Please share your feedback and advice how I can reach such companies?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

            <p>I hope I’m not sharing too many idea pitches.</p>
<p>My latest idea is a tool that would send you a text message each morning that says something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Last 24 hours: 12 new email subscribers, $847 in sales.
Visit http://bit.ly/1bdDlXc for more details
</code></pre>
<p>I understand a lot of founders compulsively check their stats, especially in the morning. This could be a way to eliminate that annoying 10-minute period in the morning of going around to various dashboards.</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>

            <p>I had an idea recently to create a website where I put together a curated list of books, podcasts, conferences, websites, tools and people that would be useful to founders.</p>
<p>It would be kind of like Wikipedia for entrepreneurship. For example, if you viewed the page for the Startups for the Rest of Us podcast, there would be an associated Rob Walling page and Mike Taber page. I would say that if you like Startups for the Rest of Us, maybe you’d like Bootstrapped with Kids and Smart Passive Income.</p>
<p>Unlike Wikipedia, everything would be from my personal perspective and I would include my own subjective opinions. A dry presentation of facts would be boring and not super helpful, I think. It would actually be almost more of a review site than an encyclopedic site.</p>
<p>Obviously, the maintenance of this resource could turn into a colossal undertaking, but let’s not focus on that for now. What I’m curious about is whether people would find this valuable.</p>
<p>This idea stems from my own desire to discover podcasts, books, etc. that are worth my time.</p>
<p>Would you find this valuable?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am thinking about creating a collaborative screen sharing application with dual cursors. This is similar to ScreenHero which is no longer available standalone after acquisition by Slack.</p>
<p>Does this sound like something you would want to use and would pay for? If you are interested please register at <a href="http://superscreenshare.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://superscreenshare.com/</a></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am thinking about creating an IDE for Angular applications. This would be based on open source Visual Studio Code, have full support for Angular template autocompletion, Typescript code completion, out of the box debugging support, etc.</p>
<p>Does this sound like something you would want to use and would pay for?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

          <title>How much would you pay for</title>

            <p>How much (per month) would you pay for the service, integrated with Stripe, which does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability to create customizable (very little) “invoice”: logo, service name, amount, customer name+.</li>
<li>Ability to create “invoice” programaticaly (API call).</li>
<li>Ability to embed “invoice” in your SaaS so customer can enter CC info as a part of the subscription process, or change it later as a part of the account management.</li>
<li>Ability to schedule requiring or one time auto-payments for the invoice.</li>
<li>Ability to configure number of auto-retries and intervals between auto-retries if payment fails.</li>
<li>Ability to send invoice (in opposite to auto-charging) so customer can “pay now”.</li>
<li>Ability to configure web hooks to receive notifications.</li>
</ol>
<p>We were looking for ready-to-use service for Integrator, used payfunnels (it supports use-cases 1 and 6) for a while, ended up developing our own. Now I’m thinking about bootstrapping it.</p>
<p>Advantages: flat and relatively low price, laser focused on seven use-cases above, plug-and-play (zero or almost zero programming), supports esoteric models such as on-premise saas and partner program .</p>
<p>Note: I’m aware about “works with stripe” program and tried quite a few of them (but definitely not all). Most are either expensive or do not really support subscription model without programming. I’m also aware about Stripe subscription API, which is really good but has its own problems.</p>

            <p>Hey everyone! Currently i’m struggling to find interesting idea for a product to work on and i’ve decided to do good old scratching your own itches <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>:<br>
I have lots of sources of information i’m reading and consuming everyday:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Rss</li>
<li>Telegram channels</li>
<li>Regular websites</li>
</ul>
<p>And it requires me on a daily purpose checking those sources to see if anything interesting pops up. It takes time, sometimes i’m forgetting about certain website (yep, that happens quite often) and distracts me.</p>
<p><strong>Idea</strong>:<br>
App that allows you to enter urls of things you are interested in, set any kind of periodicity ( every 3, 12, 24 hours) and you will get a summary of those sources in you inbox as a newsletter. By using some magic, this app will try to find relevant things to you and put them on top.</p>
<p><strong>Questions</strong>: What do you think in general about this idea? Would you pay any decent amount 2-4 bucks for it on monthly basis? Anything else you would add to it that would help you to efficiently consume information from the internets?</p>
<p>Thanks and looking forward to your answers.</p>
<p>Oleksii.</p>

          <title>Need feedback on our pivoted value proposition, targeting entrepreneurs</title>

            <p>The organization and productivity tool we built, <a href="https://dynalist.io/?ref=bootstrapped" rel="nofollow noopener">Dynalist</a>, is a simple list-making app that helps you manage projects and businesses (and anything complex, really).</p>
<p>Please help us out by reading the following pitch and see if you’re interested. Comments are much appreciated! If you don’t have time to elaborate, simply replying whether you would find it useful would help too <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>
<hr>
<h3>The pitch</h3>
<p>As entrepreneurs, we have a lot of things to manage. I’ve tried Trello, Basecamp, and JIRA, and none of them really worked for me. For some reason, they all end up being too messy to work with after some time.</p>
<p>Dynalist sets out to solve this problem, with three bits of magic:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Lists in Dynalist are not flat, but infinitely nestable.</strong> Each subtasks can have subtasks that have more subtasks, etc. Theoretically, no matter how big your project is, you can eventually break them down so that each piece is actionable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Each list is also a context.</strong> You can hide a context by folding a list, or focus on a context by zooming in on a list. Dynalist is your personal workspace, and you can reflect what’s on your mind onto Dynalist with a few clicks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get quick access to the info you need.</strong><br>
You can:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tags things with # or @ to group them;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bookmark any list item or search result;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch to any document or bookmark with a few keystrokes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Some background information (read only if you’re interested):</p>
<p>We launched last year and got some users. We have all kinds of users: entrepreneurs, freelancers, researchers, students, writers, software engineers, etc. For the longest time we could not figure out what our targeted audience should be.</p>
<p>Our gut feeling tells us Dynalist would be useful to anyone that needs to organize and keep track of a relatively large amount of information. So housewives who only make grocery lists twice a week don’t count; they won’t benefit much from Dynalist over apps like Wunderlist and Remember The Milk.</p>
<p>However, without better targeting, marketing was really hard.</p>
<p>Very recently, after coming back from a startup conference, we had a realization that entrepreneurs like ourselves would benefit a lot from Dynalist, and we should try this as the niche market to start with. Guaranteed, entrepreneurs have a lot of manage every day by definition. Lots of things happen even in the smallest startup companies. Also we have a better idea of the pain points of entrepreneurs and how to target them than almost any other group.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m posting to get some feedback to validate or invalidate this particular value proposition.</p>
