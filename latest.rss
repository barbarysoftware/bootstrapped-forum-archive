            <p>Hi, it seems Dark Mode has been enabled for these forums… how do I turn it off again? There’s no option in the Settings that I can see. Thanks.</p>

            <p>I discovered <a href="https://sockratescustom.com/">Sockrates</a> a few weeks ago, it looks like a fun way to send a gift to your customers or in a tradeshow. They seems to work with big companies like Dell.</p>
<p>Did you tried this kind of gift already? I’m curious of the “ROI” of it</p>

            <p>Hi all, sorry to be joining you at the last minute! We are a New Zealand company wanting to start selling a desktop B2B software product. As this is an old-skool downloaded item and most providers now seem to be expecting SaaS, we would really appreciate any recommendations for providers who can still deal with software downloads. Many thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi all, some of you may remember me as the former owner of Saber Feedback. I’ve been living the 9-5 life for a couple of years now, but the old side project itch has returned <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blush.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>
<p>I realise this community is not long for this world, but I’d really appreciate feedback from you all on my <em>very</em> early stage project. (It’s just a demo video and some basic questions at the moment)</p>

          <title>Future of the Bootstrapped community forum</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[SteveMcLeod]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Discussions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>TLDR:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>On July 24, 2021 this community will enter “read-only” mode.</li>
<li>On or after August 24, 2021, this community will go offline.</li>
<li><strong>The <a href="https://bootstrapped.fm/">Bootstrapped podcast</a> will continue</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I took over the running of this community two and a half years ago, when it had already been in decline for some time. I tried to breath some new life into the community, but it has proven to be difficult.</p>
<p>There’s a solid amount of daily traffic, but few people contribute new topics for discussion. We’re a prime example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)">the 90/9/1 rule</a>.</p>

<em>Bootstrapped community pageviews for the last 12 months</em></p>
<p>Running the community uses my time and money on an ongoing basis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosting the Discourse software costs $100/month. Self-hosting is a free-ish alternative but would require more time, and something I’m not interested in doing.</li>
<li>There’s a steady flow of spammy postings that need to be deleted or, rarely, allowed through. The Discourse software does do a great job of auto-detecting these.</li>
</ul>
<p>In recent months I’ve spent time participating in similar communities to see what they do differently. What I’ve found is:</p>
<ul>
<li>in 2021, many online communities struggle to maintain a decent level of participation</li>
<li>successful communities often have one or more paid employees (eg. IndieHackers has 2 or 3 full-time employees and the financial backing of Stripe, who own it).</li>
<li>paid communities have more open sharing</li>
<li>tiny private groups (eg. a 10- to 20- person Slack group) work well for creating a strong sense of community, solidarity, and mutual help,</li>
<li>For me, Twitter is better than the Bootstrapped community for asking questions when I need advice for a specific business problem</li>
</ul>
<p>I considered approaching relevant companies (eg Paddle) to see if I could get some decent sponsorship of the community, thus allowing me to hire a part-time community manager. But  this would be a form of sales. I’m busy enough doing sales for my own company, and don’t have the motivation to do for this community too.</p>
<p>The rough plan for closing down (still open to change):</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll leave this topic (the one you’re reading right now) open for discussion for a while.</li>
<li>In about a month, I’ll switch the forum to read-only mode.</li>
<li>In about two months, I’ll close down the forum altogether.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not a decision I’ve reached easily. I’ve been contemplating this for six months.</p>
<p><strong>I’m open to alternative solutions and ideas!</strong> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Recommended alternative communities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indie Hackers</a> if you are just getting started and want to chat with others just getting started</li>
<li>
<a href="https://foundersummit.co/">Founder Summit</a> (paid) if your business is viable and you like to run a calm company</li>
<li>
<a href="https://microconf.com/microconf-connect">MicroConf Connect</a> “a space for founders and their teams of independently funded startups to connect with like minded individuals.”</li>
<li>
<a href="https://megamaker.co/">MegaMaker</a> - A paid community for bootstrappers</li>
<li>Find 10 or so people at a similar stage in your businesses and make a private Slack account.</li>

            <p>I am interesting in options for flipping (selling) a Saas business. My main caveat is I don’t want someone that will just want to screw it over to extract money and disappoint the current users who are small business owners. There are two part time employee’s who preferably would stay on board (in Australia).</p>
<p>Health reasons make it difficult for me and I have other on going stuff as well.</p>
<p>What is the best place to look to find a conscientious buyer?</p>

<p>Gamification, dark patterns, artificial “roadblocks”, notifications frameworks that exist only to hook you into the product - why bootstrappers shouldn’t mindlessly copy these techniques.</p>

          <title>Hi, I&#39;m Tom from HelpfulDocs (we create and manage your help content)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[helpfuldocs]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Introductions</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi all, I’m Tom Sylvan from the HelpfulDocs team. I’m very excited to be here <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><strong>Here is what we do:</strong><br>
Good help content (such as knowledge base articles and product updates) is crucial for the success of any product. This is especially true for serve-serve products where users have to onboard themselves, and learn how to use the product on their own.</p>
<p>We’ve worked for quite a few companies and almost every team struggled to build the necessary workflows that ensured the help content was always correct and updated. And when they did, there was a human resource bottleneck: who will write and update the content on a recurring basis?</p>
<p>Having old or inconsistent documentation impacts directly every product business, even though it’s hard to measure this. It impacts conversion rates and churn, as it makes it harder to use and learn the product. It also makes both sales (if you do sales) and support more demanding as you need to spend more time explaining the same things and answering the same questions.</p>
<p>So HelpfulDocs is the solution to this problem: a help content creation agency that builds automated workflows for ensuring help content always correct and updated. We focus on help content both in-app (e.g., onboarding guides, product updates, changelogs etc.) and in external tools (e.g., your website, help center, CMS, email marketing tool, etc.)</p>

            <p>Hi, I’m Andrew, originally from Ireland.</p>
<p>I worked over the past few years in product and ops at a number of startups (primarily in SE Asia). Now, I’ve started NeoCoach, an app that pairs you 1-on-1 with an expert coach.</p>
<p>Ever think it’s funny that we outsource many things in our life (our haircuts, medical advice, accounting, teaching) but often try to manage our fitness completely on our own? NeoCoach is changing that!</p>
<p>At a very early stage of company building and I hope I can find some helpful tips in this community as well as contribute my fair share. I’m glad to be a part of this community and look forward to meeting you all.</p>
<p>Any and all feedback is always sought after, and more than happy to offer the community access if anyone is interested <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

          <title>Tips on Software Download, Review and Listing Pages</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m currently working on posting my new desktop program in software listing pages. I want to get backlinks, user reviews and some traffic.</p>
<p>Any advice? I see that listing pages can put pressure on software publishers:</p>
<ul>
<li>By NOT moderating user reviews, or doing so in their favour.</li>
<li>By writing and publishing themselves competitor’s pages, which are obviously unclaimed, but they can link those pages to your page.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a good list of the major Software List sites. I’m open to share it, just DM me. Some are exclusively for B2B, there are lots of management software listings for any sector you imagine! Although, most are quite open to any software category and also allow B2C.</p>
<p>A different, but related question: Anyone here using <a href="https://appvisor.com/pad">PAD files</a>? They contain the basic info of your software so you can send you software specs faster, in an easy and standard way. I see they’re still a thing. Yet, they look old, outdated and clumsy as hell, but many pages still use them.</p>
<p>Also, for people using listing pages, do they make a substatial traffic/lead generation contribution for you?</p>

<p>Both Ed and Steve are feeling a little bit stressed, perhaps at the beginning of burnout. We discuss why this might be, and what we are doing about it.</p>
<p><strong>This episode is the end of the current season.</strong></p>
<p>A new mini-season starts next with an acting guest host stepping in for the next few weeks while I take a break. In this episode we reveal our who guest host will be.</p>
<p>Who is the guest host? A clue: I interviewed the guest host on a recent episode that is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw2fdiY8JkDPbGaurnoh_1g">the Bootstrapped YouTube channel</a>.</p>

            <p>In the last few months, Liz Painter did some interviews on our behalf with Feature Upvote customers.</p>
<p>The process went well, so I invited Liz to write up her process for conducting customer interviews for our blog.</p>

<p>Nick Swan was about to launch paid plans for his SaaS when a sudden terrible life event changed everything for Nick and his family.</p>
<p>“The doctor said, ‘You have to go the main hospital now. Drive straight up there. Don’t even pack a bag.’ He didn’t say what it was, but he said it was serious.”</p>
<p>We discuss how this affected his life, his family and his mentality as a bootstrapper.</p>

          <title>SMS greeting cards - Schedule SMS for important events</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[SauvignonBlanc]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Idea Pitches</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I was thinking about how I usually forget about someone’s bday or anniversary or such more important occasions. If there isn’t for Facebook I wouldn’t remember it all, unless I create a reminder on my phone.</p>
<p>How about a website or an app where people could order SMS greetings such as and subscribe to it annually.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if my friend Anna has a birthday I would write personalised SMS which will be sent every year on her birthday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if I’m a parent I might want to order some cool text from Santa Clause or some fictional character like Spiderman I can get it here and my kid will get that text message from fictional character</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem here would be that the other person would get an SMS from unknown phone number.</p>
