<p><p>Hello, I'm Ben. I have been trying to create a startup for years but never really had enough follow-through to finish it. I was on the BOS forums back when they were popular and got lots of great ideas. I finally had an epiphany and have been working on my product for the last six months in the evenings and weekends when I am not at my day job.</p>

<p>My product came from my wife's recent job change. She decided to quit her profession and start a photography business. Since I had the business knowledge it was easy for her to focus on what she loved while I did the back-end work. That works great for her but when I started looking around for tools to help her run the business herself, I noticed that there were plenty of individual tools that could accomplish much more than she needed but nothing integrated. So my product, <a href="http://www.exposurehq.com" rel="nofollow">ExposureHQ</a>, is designed for photography businesses and lets them keep client info, scheduling, sales, web, social media and finances all in one integrated application with lots of automation.</p></p>
