<p><p>I am a self-educated software developer and businessman. Since 2001 I've been interested in computer science. I started developing software for myself as a hobby with Visual Basic, Object Pascal and C++; later I learned .NET and C#, when I started to work in an office company (VoIP, call centers).</p>

<p>In 2007 I read few books about motivation, business and time management: I started to dream big dreams of being a CEO of large worldwide software company and having lots of money. With help of various affirmations and my inner intelligence, I made a few attempts to start my own business: developed a speech recognition engine, FOREX/stock trading robot, facial recognition algorithm. In 2011 I became a successful full-time freelancer, i.e. independent consultant. Being independent of office and work schedule, I was still not satisfied without having my own software product.</p>

<p>Since 2011 I am distributing my "StarTrinity SIP Tester" product which has a great success on the worldwide software market. It is profitable since 2013. I have other products being developed as well.</p>

<p>In 2015 I decided to share my experience of one-man-company business, started to write a book about the software business</p></p>
