    <title>Hiring a &quot;Tech Entrepreneur in Training&quot;</title>

    <description>DNSimple is growing our team in 2020, and one of the positions I&#39;ve been considering adding is a General Manager. After discussing with one of the current DNSimple team members about what my expectations are for this new hire, I started thinking about a different twist on the role, and I&#39;d like to get feedback from the Bootstrapped folks.

I want to hire a developer that can help me automate some of our non-automated business processes. In return I will pay said developer (of course) and perhaps more importantly I will mentor them on the tools and techniques that I&#39;ve used over the last 10 years to operate DNSimple. The ideal candidate will be a developer looking to launch their own sustainable, profitable, business. I would expect them to stay on for 1 to 2 years, helping my automate, while I help them improve their operational skills.

            <p>That sounds amazing and would have been a dream for me when looking to start TheoremReach.</p>
<p>I think if you can find the right candidate, you’ll be spot on. I really like this idea.</p>

            <p>Yes, furthermore I’d work with them to ensure we include specific addendums to our contract with them so that they retain the IP rights for their business. I did this when I first started DNSimple and I want to ensure that there is no questions around the IP they retain.</p>

            <p>It’s definitely a cool idea.</p>
<p>Would you allow them to work on the biz while working at dnsimple? The stability of a paycheck tends to make bootstrapping a side biz easier in the early years.</p>

            <p>I personally think that’s a great idea. There’s a lot to be said for recognizing that it would be a 1-2 year role and embracing that. That’s plenty of time to help build out infrastructure so that you’ve got some valuable tools when/if they move on and launch their own thing.</p>
