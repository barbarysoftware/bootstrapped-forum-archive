    <title>AMA with Rand Fishkin &amp; Promise Phelon this week</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/ama-with-rand-fishkin-promise-phelon-this-week/4308</link>
    <description>Two interesting online AMAs this week that might be interesting for different reasons.

Rand Fishkin (today), who gave a very honest talk recently at BoS Europe about the mistakes and regrets he has had in growing Moz, (and some of the things that he wouldn&#39;t change).

Promise Phelon (Thursday), one time head of product at BEA, now CEO of TapInfluence, who will be talking at this year&#39;s BoS USA on what culture really means in business.
