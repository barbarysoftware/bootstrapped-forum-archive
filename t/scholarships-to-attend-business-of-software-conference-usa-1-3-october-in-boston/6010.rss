    <title>Scholarships to attend Business of Software Conference USA, 1-3 October in Boston</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/scholarships-to-attend-business-of-software-conference-usa-1-3-october-in-boston/6010</link>
    <description>Scholarship Tickets are still available for Business of Software Conference USA next month in Boston. BoS is always full of bootstrappers, and is a great place to meet other people who are maybe a few steps ahead of you who can give you some great advice. If you&#39;re bootstrapping and unable to pay the full price for a ticket, apply for a scholarship - we&#39;ve got over 10 to give out and would love them to go to deserving members of the community!

As @SteveMcLeod said of last year&#39;s event: &quot;The real value is that the speakers and many of the attendees run successful software companies, and they all gave generously of their time over meals and drinks. People running companies with 25, 100, and even 200 employees politely asked about my business, then offered insights into what I could do better. It helped me to hone my positioning and marketing strategy.&quot;
