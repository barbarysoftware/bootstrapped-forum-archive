    <title>Where can i get writing done that is similar and not an outright copy?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/where-can-i-get-writing-done-that-is-similar-and-not-an-outright-copy/3430</link>
    <description>I want an article rewritten so that it has similar content but not a direct clone. What is this called and is there any way I can get this outsourced?

I also want a website that I want copied but with rewritten and some reworkings here and there so that it isn&#39;t an exact copy but has the same content and style.</description>

<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>And it isn’t that hard to write an original article anyway.</p>
<p>If you must outsource it, rather than copying, sorry “spinning”, why don’t you just hire a writer to write an original article? Unless it’s something like Quantum mechanics (&amp; maybe even then), most writers know how to do research. I’d say it’s part of the job.</p>

            <p>I think the term is “spinning”. You can get it done on oDesk (UpWork).</p>
<p>Would like to know other people’s experiences of this - mine aren’t that great.</p>
