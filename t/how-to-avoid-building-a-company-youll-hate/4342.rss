    <title>How to avoid building a company you&#39;ll hate</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-to-avoid-building-a-company-youll-hate/4342</link>
    <description>Hey gang,

My partners and I just finished a year-long exploration to determine the next business we would run.  We focused hard on how to avoid building a company that we&#39;d hate running.

I want to share it here _because in 8 years of bootstrapping I&#39;ve never seen anyone write about how to figure this out_.  It&#39;s MASSIVELY important, especially for bootstrappers who are in this to live life on their own terms.

The intro is a good summary:

&gt; How do you know if the business you&#39;re running will enable you to live the life you want to live? This was a major question we grappled with during our year-long search for our next business venture, a process we imaginatively termed &quot;Project Next Biz&quot;.

You can read the whole post here:
http://blog.codetree.com/articles/how-to-avoid-building-a-company-youll-hate.html

Would love any feedback or experiences you&#39;ve had doing this.

<p>Darn… that means I did a <em>TERRIBLE</em> job marketing this old article (written about 3 years ago):</p>
<p><a href="http://nichediver.com/entrepreneurship/ultimate-guide-to-avoiding-business-ideas-that-suck/" rel="nofollow noopener">Ultimate Guide to Avoiding Business Ideas That Suck</a></p>

<p>Obviously there’s a bit of a different spin on the matter but it seems strange to think that anyone in this group could avoid stumbling across such an article for so long.  Even more strange to imagine that not a single one of us (or a dozen) would have written a handful of our own as well.</p>
<hr>
<p>Other titles written around that same time:</p>
<p><em>“The Secret to Starting a Business You’ll Be Happy To Own”</em><br>
<em>“What’s Your Business Idea Missing? (Probably <span class="hashtag">#4</span> or <span class="hashtag">#6</span>)”</em><br>
<em>“Are You Being Too Picky About Your Business Idea?”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>And the one about starting with the end in mind:</p>
<p><em>“Get Unstuck – You’ll Never Ignore This Advice Again”</em></p>
<hr>
<p>It’s all out there… just not packaged in your own unique way… until now that is.  Thanks for sharing.</p>

            <p>It’s a nice heuristic to help one focus on providing value to one’s clients.<br>
E.g. I am not an accountant, I should not do my own taxes. Will doing accounting help me make more sales?</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/avdi">@avdi</a> It’s interesting that the CTT links are such a strong negative signal to you that the content of a 3700 word article appears to be clickbait. Good feedback tho, thx.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/dominicstpierre">@dominicstpierre</a>  Very cool.  In my experience building a co will always be a slog but like you once I stop having fun too many days in a row, I reevaluate.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/rfctr">@rfctr</a> thx for the perspectives. i don’t think it’s a waste of time at all to think about your ideal outcome and construct a situation that you think will maximize your chances of achieving it.  like i wrote above, i’ve never read about anybody going through this kind of process before, so thought it was worth sharing in case others found it valuable.</p>
<p>writing it after the fact might make it more impactful, but startup stories are full of survivorship bias - how true are they, <em>really</em>?  we may fall flat on our faces but if we do it won’t be because we didn’t know what we wanted or what we thought was a good path to achieve it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I  don’t think they show contempt for readers though</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The “natural” way would be to write a piece of copy so awesome that a reader couldn’t help but share it. When a sentence has to be highlighted and scripted to draw the reader’s attention to it, may be it is not so good to be shared in the first place?</p>
<p>Now, about your post.</p>
<p>It was moderately interesting. What stops me from being fully excited about it is this: suppose you have taken your business to the $10M you define as a success, and <em>then</em> write this post. The post then would have a lot of value because it shows a results-proven way of thinking. But at this point it is just a … mmm… hypothesis. You have a <em>theory</em> that if you plan everything like that, with criteria like that, you may get to your ideal business. But what if not? What if you somehow end up in the same old 60 hrs/wk mode with investors telling you what to do? Is it a thinking process’ fault (and then the whole post has zero value) or you deviated from your own plan?</p>
<p>In short, you should have written this post after. Way after.</p>
<p>(I mean, if you planned to share the knowledge, and not just get a number of shares.)</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/kareem">@kareem</a> I’m building <a href="https://roadmap.space" rel="nofollow noopener">Roadmap</a>, I kind of started from where I wanted to be in 3-4 years, also it’s funny you were mentioning previous app that was crawling for data and that’s kind of always something that needs to changed / fixed etc. I did not wanted to do that.</p>
<p>Also, I was wanting the product to fit with my values.</p>
<p>In short I did not wanted to be where I was being CTO of previous startup. Family always was a priority and I kind of let a startup completely take over, so not only I quit, but it <a href="https://roadmap.space/blog/2016-08-28-feeling-overwhelmed-made-me-quit-build-roadmap/" rel="nofollow noopener">made me build Roadmap</a>, I’m talking about this in this blog post.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/andy">@andy</a> I think we might feel a little differently about those links. I  don’t think they show contempt for readers though <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  But what I think really doesn’t matter much - it’s what readers think that matters.  So I’ll pay a little more attention to those b/c of your feedback - thanks!</p>

<p>Sorry for going all grumpy old codger. But things like that seem (to me) to show a certain level of contempt for your audience. And that isn’t something I would ever want to do, regardless of what the metrics say.</p>
<p>Or maybe it is just me that feels like that? In which case you can safely disregard my comment.</p>

            <p>Interesting read. I just quit a startup where I was CTO, and I agree with lots of items in your article.</p>
<p>I took a similar path to decide what to do next, and the product I’m building should project me where I want to be in future.</p>

            <p>Interesting article. But I find the ‘click to tweet’ links rather patronising. I know how to tweet and I don’t need to be told what bits to tweet.</p>

            <p>Hey gang,</p>
<p>My partners and I just finished a year-long exploration to determine the next business we would run.  We focused hard on how to avoid building a company that we’d hate running.</p>
<p>I want to share it here <em>because in 8 years of bootstrapping I’ve never seen anyone write about how to figure this out</em>.  It’s MASSIVELY important, especially for bootstrappers who are in this to live life on their own terms.</p>
<p>The intro is a good summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do you know if the business you’re running will enable you to live the life you want to live? This was a major question we grappled with during our year-long search for our next business venture, a process we imaginatively termed “Project Next Biz”.</p>
