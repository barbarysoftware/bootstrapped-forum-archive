    <title>Hello! I am Daniel</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hello-i-am-daniel/624</link>
    <description>I am pretty new.

After reading Start Small, Stay Small!  I thought I might be able to do something.  I started selling my product 6 months ago and I&#39;ve even sold a few licenses!  I never thought I would get that far!  I enjoy talking to customers and making a product that they (and I) want.

I&#39;m looking to pick up tips to become more successful and engage in the community.  I found you via Andy Brice through the Business of Software forum.  I really enjoyed the podcast with him, and now I&#39;ve listened to the one from Rachel Andrew.  Good, inspiring interviews!</description>
