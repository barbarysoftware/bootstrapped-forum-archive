    <title>Can anyone recommend a great ecommerce guided course or mentor?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/can-anyone-recommend-a-great-ecommerce-guided-course-or-mentor/3655</link>
    <description>I want to move away from writing software as a side-gig, just not interested in doing that.  I&#39;d love to start an E-commerce business but I&#39;m having an immense amount of trouble finding a product that would sell.

When I think I&#39;m onto something I have lots of second thoughts, and would love some guidance based in experience.

Other members of my family are interested in doing something similar and I&#39;m sort of guiding the way.</description>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>Just today, I got an email in my Inbox from FEInternational where Ismael (a broker of theirs) launched an ebook about insights regarding eCommerce sites taken from sales of 250 sites.</p>
<p>It’s free, but only for the next 4 days.  After that, it’s $5.</p>
<p>That may be a good place to start for “best practices” and things to avoid in the biz:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0189QRW5C" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0189QRW5C</a></p>
