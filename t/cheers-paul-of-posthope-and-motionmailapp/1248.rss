    <description>Hello fellow bootstrappers,

My name is Paul and I live in southern California with my 2 dogs, wife and our daughter. To pay the bills, I work full time as the technical director for a local Digital Agency. In my free time, I started a non-profit called http://posthope.org/ as a way to help individuals and family&#39;s through difficult medical crises.  I also recently launch http://motionmailapp.com/ into public beta. It provides email marketers an easy way to create countdown timers for their email campaigns. 

Hope to learn a lot and contribute to the community!</description>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/andrey">@andrey</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/gavin">@gavin</a> for the welcome.</p>
<p>A client at work was doing a big product launch and our email designer designed a countdown timer as a part of their teaser campaign. I ended up throwing the server side code together for generating the timers just for this campaign. After the campaign was over, I did some competitive research and really could not find anything on the market. In the end, lack of competition, demand and the fact that most of the people looking for this feature run e-commerce businesses was enough to make it a SaSS.</p>
