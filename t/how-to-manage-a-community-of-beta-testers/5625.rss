    <title>How to manage a community of beta testers?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-to-manage-a-community-of-beta-testers/5625</link>
    <description>Hey all,

What services do you use to manage a community of beta testers?

I would like to have alist of my testers, the ability to email them all, and also a private forum where they can give feedback on the feedback. A private little community basically.

I found [mobilize.io](http://mobilize.io) which seems to hit the nail on the head. Has anybody used their services?

How do you handle this?

Thanks, Oliver</description>

<p>Right but the advantage of Mobilize is my users can interact with it without creating an account. They can just reply to emails and never sign up. I think they can even vote on polls without signing up.</p>

<p>That’s expected from a public beta, but I am making my beta private (invitation only).</p>

            <p>And even less people will want to create a mobilize account just to give you feedback. It cuts both ways.</p>
<p>Personally I just make it easy for people to contact me the way they want (<a href="https://blog.kowalczyk.info/contactme.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://blog.kowalczyk.info/contactme.html</a>), I make it clear that I invite feedback and for my product I have a <a href="https://www.discourse.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Discourse</a> forum (<a href="https://forum.sumatrapdfreader.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forum.sumatrapdfreader.org/</a>).</p>
<p>I don’t care about “private” part but I think discourse could be configured that way.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t over-think it (perfect being enemy of good) and I also wouldn’t assume that people really want e-mail blasts from you.</p>
<p>I also wouldn’t expect great engagement. My guess-estimate is that the ratio of “users” to “users willing and capable of giving meaningful feedback” is at least 1/100, so unless you have thousands of users, don’t expect much in the way of the feedback and even less in way of meaningful feedback.</p>

            <p>I totally get the want to have a product specifically for this, but what about for an FB group?</p>
<p>I just wonder if adding one more thing for ppl is too much? Open to hearing criticism.</p>
<p>I’m about to do a beta launch but would like to know more about the proper way to run it. I have an idea, but the gneral thing is to test whether my hypothesis is right that this is useful for them and how often they use it.</p>
