    <title>Talker10.com - An audible social hub</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/talker10-com-an-audible-social-hub/3286</link>
    <description>Hello, I am really glad to let you know about Talker10.com- an audible social hub. Although it&#39;s currently in dev stage, it gets the features of talking and sharing your voice with others. The concept is to find out a new experience through natural imotional expression. 

So, please check that out, and feel free to let me know your feedback, what else you would have wanted there.... Thank you a lot!
