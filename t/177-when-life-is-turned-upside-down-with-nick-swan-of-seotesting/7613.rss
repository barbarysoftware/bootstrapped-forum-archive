    <description>&lt;iframe height=&quot;200px&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; seamless src=&quot;https://player.simplecast.com/848c7013-df68-430d-be8f-241a9b4b1da1?dark=false&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Nick Swan was about to launch paid plans for his SaaS when a sudden terrible life event changed everything for Nick and his family.

&quot;The doctor said, &#39;You have to go the main hospital now. Drive straight up there. Don&#39;t even pack a bag.&#39; He didn&#39;t say what it was, but he said it was serious.&quot;

We discuss how this affected his life, his family and his mentality as a bootstrapper.
