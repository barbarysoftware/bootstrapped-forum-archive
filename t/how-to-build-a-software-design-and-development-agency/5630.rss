    <title>How to build a Software Design and Development Agency</title>

    <description>Hello Bootstrapped Community!

I&#39;m interesting to build Software Design and Development Agency, but I don&#39;t know what steps must I do to build it from scratch?. Anyone here have an agency, and would to share your stories, tips and tricks, and some advice? My inspiration is like Metalab, Zurb, and Thoughtbot.

Thank you :slight_smile:</description>
