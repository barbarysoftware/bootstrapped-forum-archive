    <title>Idea: Email based task management for small teams</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/idea-email-based-task-management-for-small-teams/2664</link>
    <description>**The problem**
As a small team, we use email as an informal to-do list. Somebody might email me to ask me to do something, I will either flag it, note it down somewhere in another app or use something like Boomerang to re-send it to me later.

This process makes it easy to miss things, clutters up inboxes and is prone to error.

**The idea**
This application is a central mailbox that allows you to add items to others&#39; to-do lists and manage yours by email.

Every day (at a time of your choosing), your to-do list for the day is sent to you by email.

You can add items to your own to-do list (or others&#39; list) by sending an email to the team&#39;s mailbox:
&gt; Ask @Dave to call the client on Wednesday

On Wednesday, the item will appear in my daily to-do list email. I can defer it by replying with something like this:
&gt; As me about #2 again next Thursday

or reply to say I have complete the task
&gt;  #2 is done, this client will meet us on Friday.

at which point it is removed from my To-do list and the person that created the task is informed that it is complete (and it&#39;s resolution).

The idea is to allow teams that are still dependant on email to manage it a little better.

Any feedback or criticism is more than welcome! :)</description>

            <p>My company uses outlook as email client. In the latest version(at least web interface), you can find the similar function like what you said. I think it’s very hard to cook it as everyone will like it and use it.</p>

            <p>Some concepts of the idea you mentioned Dave are implemented in <a href="http://flowdock.com" rel="nofollow noopener">flowdock.com</a>. With one big difference that it doesn’t rely on email anymore but uses chat messages.</p>
<p>We are building at the moment taskblitz, which is a task management tool for businesses. We’re working on NLP mechanism like you described above. But not using email but input in the application itself. I can say from our experience of building such a system: it is technically super complicated to implement.</p>

            <p>I’m surprised that nobody else has mentioned <a href="http://www.trello.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.trello.com</a> yet (there are others like <a href="http://asana.com" rel="nofollow noopener">asana.com</a> too). Both of these apps do what you’re suggesting and much much more. Personally I wouldn’t progress this idea unless you can highlight something this does over and above what those incumbent apps already offers.</p>

            <p>Good idea. Crowded space:</p>
<p>Active Inbox is great and does exactly this with gmail.<br>
NudgeMail is a newer, simpler version.</p>
<p>I’ve used a few others as well.<br>
And Google has Tasks built into Gmail (although it doesn’t yet have due dates I think)</p>

            <p>There are tons of Apps that basically do what you have above. It’s a tough space that requires total team adoption to do well. I don’t think it’s a fertile business opportunity.</p>
<p>Lucky for you, the first step is the same: Even if just satisfying your own team needs, going out and trying lots of things that could work would get you closer to evaluating if this was a real business idea or if there is already the perfect solution for you out there.</p>
<p>Wunderlist, Omnifocus, and many CRMs (such as Sugar) sound like they do some of what you’re looking for.</p>

            <p>I do use my inbox as my main to-do list manager, and I wrote more about it <a href="http://www.manuelflara.com/ultimate-todo-list-inbox/" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> if you want to know the details. When Google announced Inbox I thought that was going to be the product I always dreamed of, but it didn’t really match my expectations and I switched back to Gmail. Too opinionated. Maybe your product could be better!</p>

            <p>It’s something I would like to use (and I think we would use it internally), but I was wondering what people’s thoughts were on whether it was a business.</p>

            <p>I think task management can be a tough space to get into. Is this just for the fun/challenge of it or something you’re really wanting to turn into a business?</p>
