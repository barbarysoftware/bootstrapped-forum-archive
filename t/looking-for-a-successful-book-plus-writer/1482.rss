    <title>Looking for a successful &quot;book-plus&quot; writer</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/looking-for-a-successful-book-plus-writer/1482</link>
    <description>I&#39;m involved with organising the Edinburgh Publishing Conference, http://edinpubconf.net.

I&#39;m co-ordinating the section on new technologies and business models, and I&#39;d dearly love to include an author who&#39;s making a success out of doing what I call &quot;book-plus&quot; publishing.

What I mean by this, is where you publish a book, and offer it for sale with an set of added options: so if you want just the book, it&#39;s £30; if you want the book plus extra walkthroughs and interviews, it&#39;s £50; if you want the site license, it&#39;s £250. That kind of thing...

Examples of this are Nathan Barry, http://nathanbarry.com/books/, and the new &quot;Discover Meteor&quot; book at https://www.discovermeteor.com/packages

If you can suggest anyone who fits this category and who might make a good speaker, then please drop me an email at rachel@willmer.org. Don&#39;t be shy, feel free to suggest yourself :smile:
 
The conference is in Edinburgh, Scotland on June 20th, headline speaker Cory Doctorow. 

(We&#39;re bootstrapping the conference, so there isn&#39;t any money for speaker&#39;s fees this year but there might be some scope for travel costs.)

Thanks

<p>If you’re involved in the publishing industry, I’d encourage you to come.</p>
<p>But also we have two speakers who have really useful stuff to say about<br>
how to make money from being publishing your knowledge as a book. So if<br>
you’ve got ideas about turning what you know into a book or course, you<br>
really should be here.</p>
<p>“Productising your consulting” is how Brennan Dunn describes it; rather<br>
than getting paid by the hour on a contracting gig to be a whizz at<br>
javascript/python/UX design, write a book about it and have your<br>
knowledge making money while you sleep. Or are having fun.</p>
<p>Brennan’s talk is entitled “How I Sell A Book for $249: the magic of<br>
tiered pricing”</p>
<p>Peter Armstrong founded <a href="http://LeanPub.com">LeanPub.com</a>: authors have made over $1.5m<br>
selling their in-progress books through his site. “Publish Early,<br>
Publish Often” is a workflow which works particularly well for<br>
state-of-the-art tech books (similar to O’Reilly’s Early Access)</p>
<p>Peter’s talk is entitled “Lean Publishing: Why In-Progress Publishing is<br>
the Future, and the Past, of Publishing”</p>
<p>Use this link to get the discounted price of £79</p>

            <p>I’ve used books as paid lead gen to sell workshops, SaaS, etc. Here’s a bit more detail from my last annual report: <a href="http://planscope.io/blog/how-i-changed-the-world-in-2013/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://planscope.io/blog/how-i-changed-the-world-in-2013/</a> — brought in over $300k last year using the book-first approach to sell other stuff.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/brennandunn">@brennandunn</a> is another great example of this publishing model. I have no idea if his schedule allows for that, though <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
