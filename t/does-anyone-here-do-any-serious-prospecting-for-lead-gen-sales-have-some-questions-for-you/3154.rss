    <title>Does anyone here do any serious prospecting for lead gen/sales? Have some questions for you</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/does-anyone-here-do-any-serious-prospecting-for-lead-gen-sales-have-some-questions-for-you/3154</link>
    <description>Currently working on a tool to help with this and would love to hear from you. 

What challenges do you face when prospecting?
What is the biggest headache? 
How are you doing it currently? 
Would you be open to having a discussion and walking me through your current process?
What CRM do you use, if any?

Any feedback would be appreciated!</description>
