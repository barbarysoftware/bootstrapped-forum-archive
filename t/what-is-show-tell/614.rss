    <title>What is &#39;Show &amp; Tell&#39;?</title>

    <description>Show &amp; Tell is a place where you can show the products you&#39;ve created and tell everyone a bit about them. This is also the place to request for other forum members to evaluate your product and provide some feedback.

If you are a new forum member, you will not be able to create links until you are trusted a bit more by the system. It&#39;s a good idea to participate in some other discussions before posting your product here. A great way to start participating is to post an introduction in the &#39;Introductions&#39; category.
