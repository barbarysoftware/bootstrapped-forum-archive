    <title>Pioneers Conference in Vienna (October 29 &amp; 30, right after Microconf)</title>

    <description>Hi everyone!
On October 29th and 30th, Pioneers conference is happening in Vienna: http://www.pioneers.io
This is right after this year&#39;s Microconf Europe. The conference is about &quot;Entrepreneurship and Innovative Technologies&quot; and is quite famous in the Austrian startup scene and beyond.

I&#39;m still on the fence whether to go. On one hand, it&#39;s certainly interesting; on the other hand it seems a bit over-hyped and not very relevant to micro-ISVs.

Anyone else going?</description>
