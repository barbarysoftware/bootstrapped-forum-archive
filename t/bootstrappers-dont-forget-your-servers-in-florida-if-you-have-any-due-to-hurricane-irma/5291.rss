    <title>Bootstrappers, don&#39;t forget your servers in Florida if you have any due to Hurricane Irma</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/bootstrappers-dont-forget-your-servers-in-florida-if-you-have-any-due-to-hurricane-irma/5291</link>
    <description>Not to create panic but as bootstrappers, make sure you are keeping an eye on Hurricane Irma if you have any servers/datacenters in Florida. If you are not sure and use a cloud service, find out because there is a small chance your customers could get impacted. This is a massive hurricane and WILL destroy anything in its path.

Most importantly, stay safe but check your servers and be ready with disaster preparedness as well. Notify your clients in advance (not to create panic but to keep them ready in case something does happen).</description>
