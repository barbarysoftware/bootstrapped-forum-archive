    <title>Selling some Domain Names - too ambitious?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/selling-some-domain-names-too-ambitious/5883</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m slowly weeding out domain names in my portfolio that I&#39;m just not going to use and wondered if anyone here has had success selling names for 4 and 5 figures.

I&#39;ve started with

search4adomain.com, search4adomainname.com and search4aname.com for about $1500 asking price on flippa (for the bundle of 3)

splittracker.com, split-tracker.com and splitracker.com are bundled up for $10k and up

some other ones I have are things like search4aroom.com, onlinekeywords.com, opinionadvisor.com, opinioncrawler.com, search4words.com, search4keywords.com etc.

flippa links purposefully omitted as I&#39;m not trying to hype or advertise, I&#39;m looking for folks in the know

what do you all think? too ambitious?

I&#39;ve not been one for trading in domain names so have no idea really. Now I&#39;ve &#39;grown up&#39; regarding what I could possibly build (in terms of time/commitment and passion) I&#39;m starting to offload.

All opinions and thoughts appreciated (@ian would love your input on this)</description>

            <p>From my limited experience with domain names buy/sell I can tell you that you can get price in the range of thousand(s) only if someone’s brand/product name matches the domain name and they are profitable enough to throw some cash.</p>
<p>In all other cases people can afford in the range of hundred(s) or just think about new spare name.</p>
