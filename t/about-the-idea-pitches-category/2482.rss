    <description>[Replace this first paragraph with a short description of your new category. This guidance will appear in the category selection area, so try to keep it below 200 characters. Until you edit this text or create topics, this category won&#39;t appear on the categories page.]

Use the following paragraphs for a longer description, as well as to establish any category guidelines or rules.

Some things to consider in any discussion replies below:

- What is this category for? Why should people select this category for their topic?

- How is this different than the other categories we already have?

- Do we need this category?

- Should we merge this with another category, or split it into more categories?
