    <description>Hi there,

I have been a big fan of Bootstrapped.fm over the years but haven&#39;t had an opportunity to post anything but today I finished my project to help people learn to code. 

I would love your feedback and it would be cool to know if anyone would be interested in using such a service.

Kollege.co

Thank you</description>
