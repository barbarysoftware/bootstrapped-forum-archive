    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/halp-i-think-my-free-version-is-too-good/2912</link>
    <description>Hey guys

I&#39;m in a dilemma that I think would be interesting to discuss in here.

I&#39;m selling a WordPress plugin that has a free and a paid version. Conversion rates from free -&gt; pro are very low. Most customers using the pro version bought it directly and wasn&#39;t using the free version before. This leads me to think that my free version is simply too good. Or at least that my pro version needs more killer features. I would say that abt. 20% of paying customers upgraded from the free version. 80% started out with the pro version.

The users of the free version seems to really like it, so that&#39;s not the reason they aren&#39;t upgrading. It must be something about the features.

My dilemma is: Do I make the free version worse or should I come up with a new killer feature for the paid version? The problem is that the free version solves a very large portion of the pain-point, so the incentive to upgrade is probably not big enough, except if you explicitly need the pro features.

I&#39;ve been debating killing the free version. I&#39;ve decided not to for now, because it gives me a lot of feedback/bug reports and also a converting customer once in a while. I&#39;m going to split test my landing page without the free version and see what happens.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? It&#39;s a hard nut to crack for me.

            <p>Hey!</p>
<p>The plugin is not allowed in the .org repo, so I have to do my own thing!</p>
<p>Thanks for giving it a go! Actually, there’s an experimental feature that’ll allow you to compile stuff after installation and updates: <a href="http://blog.wppusher.com/introducing-the-wp-pusher-file/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://blog.wppusher.com/introducing-the-wp-pusher-file/</a></p>
<p>And an update: I’m working hard on my new licensing system and launching it one of these days, based on you guys suggestions! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/petersuhm">@petersuhm</a> I only got a chance to quickly install it on one site (my personal blog which I change quite frequently as a test site), but I’ll have to change my workflow a bit since I usually gitignore compiled CSS and JS. I’ll poke at it some more and send you an email, but it probably wont be for a week or so. At a glance though, it does what I expect and was easy to setup.</p>
<p>A note on the WordPress ecosystem. There are developers doing things the “normal” paid software route, and there is certainly nothing wrong with that. However, WP is kind of it’s own beast. Free plugin with paid upgrades or add-ons is pretty much what everyone is used to. Users are used to paying for things that way and devs are used to charging them that way.</p>
<p>The WordPress official plugin site requires you to use their updater. If memory serves, I think they use SVN which is why a lot of devs using git have to jump through some hoops. If <a class="mention" href="/u/petersuhm">@petersuhm</a> can put the free version on the main WP repo, making the paid version on github (which would not need the main WP repo) shouldnt cause any problems.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, there is really no compelling reason to buy an upgrade right now. It works everywhere I need it and works well (so no need for support). I really think it needs more restrictions <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>Re: free tier vs no free tier.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how other Wordpress users behave, but I prefer to try-then-buy rather than buy-then-get-money-back.</p>
<p>Trying just feels like much less trouble. Asking for money back is awkward.</p>
<p>That though doesn’t mean you have to have a free tier. I would equally easy try a plugin with 30 days evaluation period.</p>

</aside>
<p>Like <strong><em>what</em></strong> that?</p>
<p>That explanation explains nothing to me.</p>
<p>Oh, wait… your plugin allows to update plugins’ code right from Github, i.e. the <a href="http://Wordpress.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Wordpress.org</a> hosting becomes unnecessary, right? Then it makes sense.</p>

            <p>First they said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not permit plugins to phone home to other servers for updates, as we are providing that service for you with <a href="http://WordPress.org" rel="nofollow noopener">WordPress.org</a> hosting. One of our guidelines is that you actually use our hosting, and we don’t allow plugins in the repo that actively let people run updates like that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then after I explained that I wasn’t phoning home and that I thought there had been a mistake, they said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the plugin is terrible useful and totally awesome. But it’s not something we currently allow.<br>
"One of our guidelines is that you actually use our hosting, and we don’t allow plugins in the repo that actively let people run updates like that."<br>
That’s literally why we can’t allow it in the repo right now. It that changes, we’ll post about it on <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/plugins" rel="nofollow noopener">make.wordpress.org/plugins</a> but we never should have approved it, and I apologize for that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, updating from GitHub etc. is not allowed…</p>

            <p>Why even offer a free version? I have an add-on for ExpressionEngine that I developed about three years ago. For a brief period of time it was free/open on github but I decided to make it paid and took the free version down. I had a few people yell at me about it but since then I have made an average of $500/month and it is consistently highly rated and people really see the value in it.</p>
<p>Unless your service has a proven track record of high conversions from free to paid, free is obviously not a good marketing strategy. I’m not sure why everyone in the WordPress world is convinced that free is the path to salvation. A 30 day money back guarantee is a much better policy than free IMHO.</p>
<p>quick edit - if your goal/business model is to offer free software, disregard my comment. I am assuming your goal is to make money from your software.</p>

            <p>All those things are not something you could do with WP Pusher. It’s only “deployment of WordPress themes and plugins”, so it’s not the whole site or your content. It’s only code. I don’t think you are my target audience. It’s made primarily for freelancers and agencies who manage plugins and themes for their clients with Git. I think, or at least I hope, that it will be more obvious to them what the product is and does! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>Yeah… I was considering to give your service a try when I first read about it. But I did not, because you did not educate me <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>See, I have a single WP blog. There is always a nagging idea in the back of my head “what if the hoster messes things up and loses all my posts and comments and uploads and whatnot?”. Of course, I suppose to download a backup from time to time, but really, who does that?</p>
<p>So I was thinking “Hmm, keeping the whole site in Github? And being able to restore it in one keystroke? Sounds good!”… but then I realized I do not understand how that works. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is WPPusher only for code, or for content too?</li>
<li>Is it one-way, i.e. repo to WP, or two-way? I.e. will my comments be saved?</li>
<li>Is there an editor for WP posts that I can use locally?</li>
<li>What happens if I modify something via the WP Admin page?</li>
<li>What about plugins? Are they installed via Admin or, too, stored in repo?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some question may sound stupid, but – as most of WP users – I do not have a clue what is possible with WPPusher and what not. In fact, I’m not even clear about its target audience… may be the target audience is not clear about that, too?</p>

            <p>HA! Grandfathered means: “a provision in which an old rule continues to apply to some existing situations while a new rule will apply to all future cases”</p>
<p>In your case, all the existing users who have unlimited repos will continue to have unlimited repos even after you change the plans/tiers.<br>

<p>A grandfather clause (or grandfather policy) is a provision in which an old rule continues to apply to some existing situations while a new rule will apply to all future cases. Those exempt from the new rule are said to have grandfather rights or acquired rights, or to have been grandfathered in. Frequently, the exemption is limited; it may extend for a set time, or it may be lost under certain circumstances. For example, a "grandfathered power plant" might be exempt from new, more restrictive po...</p>

            <p>Great ideas!! Semi pro is a good idea. Maybe it would make sense if my “personal” license was limited to a reasonable amount of private repos maybe.</p>
<p>Also, I think I’ll have to look up what “grandfathering” means soon <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>Definitely this. Measure and see what your usage is. How many sites is it installed on, how many repos, github/bitbucket/selfhosted, private/public.</p>

<p>You have a couple of ways to tackle this (after seeing your usage patterns <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:">).</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow a single private repo. This is great for people who just have a private project, or are kicking the tires to test it.</li>
<li>Keep the free version for public only, and have a teeny-tiny “semi-pro” version for a small amount that unlocks a private repo</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the key is to remember that they are getting a value from that private repo, so deploying that code in an automated way has value too. I still maintain that the majority of private repos (free on bitbucket or paid on github) are for commercial use. Even if not, their privacy has a cost as well.</p>
<p>To avoid making all the current folks angry that they don’t have access to all of their private repos anymore, make sure you get them a chance to get grandfathered in.</p>

            <p>Spot on <a class="mention" href="/u/rfctr">@rfctr</a> as always! Thank you. Phoning home is not a bad idea. It’s not an option for plugins in the .org repository, but since they removed my plugin, I guess I could maybe do it to some extend - also regarding licenses etc.</p>

<p>The division is not “free-paid” repo, but “public-private”. Your free tier should allow public repos, but not private.</p>
<p>We <em>assume</em> that private repo correlate with commercial purposes (even if the repo wasn’t paid for), so the privacy itself is a good indicator.</p>

</aside>
<p><strong>This</strong>! This was my first thought when I seen “<em>Unlimited themes &amp; plugins, Unlimited repositories</em>” in the free tier.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/petersuhm">@petersuhm</a></p>
<p><strong>One repository only, and only a public one.</strong></p>
<p>Now, this proposed change assumes there is a number of free users that “abuse” the product by using it for many repositories, and that by restricting them in this right you’d move them into a paid tier.</p>
<p>That assumption can be validated, can’t it? <strong>Can you collect statistics on the usage?</strong> Do you have a “call home” functionality in the plugin? If not, you should add it and then you can make the decision based on numbers.</p>
<p>Otherwise it could turn out that the free users only use the plugin for one repo anyway, and the needle won’t move.</p>

            <p>Yeah I agree. No private repos in the free version. If they can pay Github, they can pay you.</p>

            <p>Hey! Thanks for your input. It’s really great.</p>
<p>Your ideas about limiting the amount of private repos is great I think. It’s similar to GitHub, so it’s easy for people to understand.</p>
<p>Shoot me an e-mail (<a href="mailto:peter@wppusher.com">peter@wppusher.com</a>) after you’ve tried the plugin! Would love to hear your thoughts!</p>

            <p>GREAT plugin. I’m going to give it a test drive this weekend. There is a huge market for this I would think among Wordpress developers.</p>
<p>A few ideas… I think for sure your free version is way too lenient. I’d recommend changing your free tier to have unlimited public repos (because open source), and a small number (or none) of private repos. Generally, private repos are for commercial projects. Sure a regular person might have one or two private repos, but certainly not “unlimited”. Are you collecting data on the number &amp; type of repos? You can probably find a good spot to draw the line.</p>
<p>The tougher part is how to do your pricing for the different paid versions. You could do some variation on # of private repos available or maybe how many sites the paid version can be installed on.</p>
<p>I agree that you should talk to your users about new features. Some of them can go in the free version, some will go in paid. Also reach out to communities like the AdvancedWP facebook group ( <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/</a> ) which is full of WordPress devs. They opened a slack group a few days ago as well.</p>

            <p>Hey, thanks for input!</p>
<p>I don’t think ads is the greatest idea for my product. User base is not large enough that I think it’s worth it… I think I just need to make pro more tempting. Maybe by adding some limits to the free version. Or by adding even better things to pro. It’s a bit difficult for me. I don’t have other plugins at the moment.</p>
<p>And yeah. I definitely need to talk more with my existing users! It’s a great idea <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
