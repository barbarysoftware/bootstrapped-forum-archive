    <title>Pre-qualified Leads</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/pre-qualified-leads/4221</link>
    <description>Im looking for a service that pre-qualifies leads for you. I don&#39;t need a test an idea, I need someone to talk to a specific demographic for me and find 30 people who I could then call. So I could say pre-qualify me 30 leads of this type:

For eg:
Plumbers
Living in Russia
With 10 employees in their business

I would tell that company what I was trying to pitch and they would go ahead...

Im not avoid sales (which i like to do), but rather just pre-qualifying leads.

Suggestions?</description>

<p>We partner with mobile app developers to allow their users to take in app surveys in exchange for in app content.</p>
<p>We’ve done a few of these recruitment campaigns for Hello Fresh and a few other companies with a lot of success. Basically we used our network to find the specific folks to talk to. Then as part of the survey we say you’ll offer them a gift card in exchange for a phone conversation and collect their personal info.</p>
<p>Hello Fresh would offer like  $100 Amazon gift card for a 60 minute conversation. Seemed a little excessive to me to go that high, but it seemed to guarantee engagement :).</p>

            <p>You mean to do Customer Development interviews where you talk about how you can serve them with a potential product?  Or do you mean sell an existing product?</p>
