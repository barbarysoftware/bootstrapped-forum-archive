    <description>Hey Bootstrapped.fm!

I&#39;m Rich, maker of [Failory](https://www.failory.com), a content site for entrepreneurs and startup founders. A long time ago, I turned Failory into an Open startup and started sharing my numbers, metrics, and strategies. Today, I published January&#39;s monthly report.

https://www.failory.com/open/january-2019

January has been the best month in terms of revenue since I started the project 16 months ago, which is why I am so excited about this report.

I was able to make $763.16, receive 30,663 page views and sum 4,136 email subscribers. The funniest thing is that it was the month in which I worked the less amount of time! I took a two-week holiday and I didn&#39;t even pick the computer during that time.

The reason why I made this money is that I believe I have finally found the perfect monetization strategy to monetize the site: sponsorship packages and affiliate links to startup-related tools. The money came from:

* $600 from [Genm&#39;s affiliate link](https://genm.grsm.io/RichClominson)
* $150 from 3 newsletters sponsorships of Tecla.io
* $13.16 from Amazon affiliates.

There isn&#39;t any magic behind, but I was having lots of problem with monetization. What do you think about it?</description>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/shanelabs">@shanelabs</a>!</p>
<p>It was quite funny and surprising that I dedicated only a few hours in the hole month and I was able to make so much money!</p>
<p>As for Genm, I’m currently trying it and have hired 4 / 5 apprentices to help me with content creation, SEO and social networks. Things to take into consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will need to spend some weekly time managing the apprentice and helping him/her learn about digital marketing. You need to get involved in their education.</li>
<li>Finding high-quality work is usually quite difficult, but still possible. Spend some time selecting the right apprentices.</li>
<li>Consider that you will have to dedicate some time every 3 months to reach many apprentices and schedule calls with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest is all benefits. The price is crazy and the help these apprentices can provide is great. Make sure to use <a href="https://genm.grsm.io/RichClominson" rel="nofollow noopener">my link</a> if you want to sign up, you would help me a lot!</p>
<p>Cheers and sorry for my delay!</p>

            <p>Congrats! I often find that the months I do the least are the best performing too - funny how that works (of course it’s short lived, though).</p>
<p>Curious about that GenM program you’re promoting - sounds too good to be true. Have you tried it?</p>

<p>After 18 months, in January I was finally able to figure out the best strategy to monetize Failory. I took a two-week holiday so I only worked on the project for 10 days. However, they were enough to make $763.16 and get 30,663 page views.</p>
