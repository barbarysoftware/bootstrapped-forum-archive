    <title>Developed utility, need advise on how to promote</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/developed-utility-need-advise-on-how-to-promote/2464</link>
    <description>Hi,

Me and my friend, we developed 4 simple utilities for IP and USB camera capture and now would like to somehow get them showed to potential customers. 

How to do this?

Here is the website: http://www.ipcamerastudio.com

I know that programs are very simple. We are planning to continue the development and turn them into a full featured surveillance solution, but we&#39;ve decided to start promoting them from the early beginning, not in some nice day in the future.

So that is the question: where to submit our software. Is it ethical to spam in forums? I mean, posting new topics that promotes the project.

Appreciate any advices.

Thanks,
- Alex.</description>

<p>What behavior is acceptable varies by forum, but if it feels like spam to you, it probably is good to avoid.  Some forums allow a single post about a relevant product, for ex.</p>
<p>I do think it’s worth finding relevant forums and seeing what the posting policy is, and also how much it costs to advertise on the site.  Beyond the forum members, forums get a lot of ‘drive-by’ traffic from people looking for answers.</p>

Simple is good. It makes the marketing easier.</p>

<p>No. Not a good idea. But include a link to your software in the body of the reply <em>if its relevant</em>. Otherwise include a link in the sig.</p>

</aside>
<p>Your low price ($19 or free) pretty much rules out paid advertising, such as AdWords.</p>
<p>I would start with the following:<br>
-SEO your site for relevant search term<br>
-write some articles of interest to people who might buy your software (e.g. ‘how to set up an IP camera’, ‘review of popular IP cameras’ etc)<br>
-write to relevant blogs and review sites and ask them to review your software (send them a free licence key)<br>
-collect the email of people who download your free software so you can market to them via email (e.g. newsletter), make sure they can unsub easily<br>
-maybe approach manufacturers of cameras and see if there is some possibility of partnership (easier if you have a bit of traction)</p>
<p>I’m not sure if I would bother submitting to download sites these days. They are so full of crud you might get penalized by Google for backlinks (does anyone have evidence either way on this?).</p>

<p>NB/ The marketing is generally a lot harder than the developing!</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
