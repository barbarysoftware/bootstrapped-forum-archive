    <title>Release Notes Conference</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/release-notes-conference/3498</link>
    <description>I know we have more than a few Bootstrapped.fm listeners who are also fans of the Release Notes podcast. As you may know, Charles and Joe are organizing a conference focusing on building a business around iOS and Mac apps. If anyone is interested, you can find more info on the conference [here][1].

I believe Charles and Joe are both on this forum, so if anyone has any questions about the conference, please use this thread.

            <p>Thanks Andrey. I’ve been a long-time listener to Bootstrapped (and a lurker on these forums), so I really appreciate the introduction.</p>
<p>As Andrey mentioned, I’m helping organize Release Notes, which is a conference about the business of iOS and Mac development. There’s a lot of overlap between that topic and other fields like the business of Android, SaaS, and .Net development, though, so we hope and expect to have some “cross-pollination” with indies and bootstrappers from other disciplines represented. We also recognize that a lot of the business of the software business is done as consulting, so we’ll have talks and discussions about not just product work, but also independent contractors.</p>
<p>We’d love to have a contingent of <a href="http://Bootstrapped.fm" rel="nofollow noopener">Bootstrapped.fm</a> listeners at Release Notes, so please let me know if you have any questions. Tickets are available on our website (<a href="http://releasenotes.tv/conference" rel="nofollow noopener">http://releasenotes.tv/conference</a>), but sales will be ending on Oct 12th. We hope to see you there!</p>
