    <title>Email support form with Intercom?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/email-support-form-with-intercom/5300</link>
    <description>If you have a chat tool like Intercom on your site do you still have an email support form as well?  We currently have both and while I think it&#39;s working out well thus far, I wonder if it makes sense to focus just on one method of communication or the other.  Interested to hear others experiences.

            <p>We put our support@ email address on our contact page, and that gets routed to Intercom, so we keep all our conversations in one place.</p>

            <p>Yep, good call.  that’s how we have it set up now, a Gravity Form on our support page, but going to be switching to the Educate module from Intercom for our support page soon and will lose that option.  May just stick a contact page in the footer or something.</p>
<p>thanks for the suggestions.<br>

            <p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="/u/unboot">@unboot</a>  that a mail method is a good fallback plan for ad blockers of browsers with Javascript turned off.</p>
<p>You can also automatically redirect support emails to your Intercom for a seamless integration and tracking.</p>

            <p>I see that intercom sometimes gets blocked by adblockers or such.  So, at least as fallback I’d provide a form or support email.</p>
<p>By the way, you can pipe your form or email into intercom, so it doesn’t matter for you in the backend.</p>
