    <title>Landing page app with import/upload functionality</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/landing-page-app-with-import-upload-functionality/3436</link>
    <description>Hi,

I used Unbounce for some time and what really annoyed me - you should do everything with online builder.

I like to do html by myself, other guys i guess would like to hire designer/html dev - anyway output will be an html page. And it will be pain to migrate it to Unbounce.

I googled for some landing page services with upload/import support - none found.

So, i have an idea to build one, really simple app:
 - it allows page upload (html, css, images); 
 - gives some basic statistics (similar to Unbounce);
 - handles &#39;subscribe form&#39; submits and saves all emails/other info (with export of course);
 
What do you think about? Will you use it? Any important features missed?

P.S. This is landing page http://www.gettouchdown.com. Any comments appreciated.

Thanks!</description>

<p>I really curious about it too! It is indeed good question.</p>
<p>I’m trying to measure it with landing page, not much results as for now (just started though).</p>
<p>I would really appreciate some recommendations how to measure the market.</p>

            <p>As a developer I can build the HTML and CSS for a landing page quicker and easier than with Unbounce’s tools (I’ve done both). The problem is the rest of the stuff takes time - unless you have ready to go hosting setting that, the domain, analytics, split testing, mailing list etc will take much longer than you think. I’d happily pay for a platform that let’s me avoid all that. Unbounce’s $45/month for each idea I just want to test the waters with makes me balk though. I think there is an opportunity for a developer friendly landing page service, but as <a class="mention" href="/u/mpalmer">@mpalmer</a> says, I wonder how big the market is.</p>

            <p>As a fellow “I know what I’m doing, and I’m going to do it” person, I share your pain with the extreme “inflexibility” and lack of power (as we perceive it) in existing lowest-common-denominator tools.</p>
<p>The difficulty with making a service which caters to this crowd is that people who know what they’re doing with HTML/CSS are <em>probably</em> going to be like that in other ways, and rather than dropping a few dollars on your service, are likely just to fire up another vhost on the VPS they no doubt have laying around.</p>
<p>My perception of small services is to target audiences which will consider your service to be closer to “magic”, and see that they’d have quite a hard time doing what you provide, and so they give you their money and move on with their business.  There are a small percentage of people who <em>could</em> do it themselves who are enllightened enough to value their time accurately and outsource everything that makes economic sense to, but… “small percentage” does not make a profitable business nearly so much as “oooh, magic!”</p>
