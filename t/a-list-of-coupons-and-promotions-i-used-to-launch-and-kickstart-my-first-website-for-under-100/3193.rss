    <title>A list of coupons and promotions I used to launch and kickstart my first website for under 100$</title>

    <description>Hey guys,

I recently launched my first website with the help of some coupons and promotions I&#39;ve been saving up for the past few years and wrote a blog post about it:

ttbooks.io/blogs/4

I posted it on reddit and was told that there might be some interest in this community so I decided to leave the link here.

Cheers</description>
