    <title>What do Bootstrappers use for issue tracking?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/what-do-bootstrappers-use-for-issue-tracking/7156</link>
    <description>We use Jira for issue tracking/bug tracking. But I feel there must be a better, lighter alternative for tiny teams.

What are you using for issue tracking? Or what _would_ you use if you could? What are its pros and cons?</description>

            <p>I use Mantis, it’s mostly OK but its UI is dated and some operations require many clicks, while it could be easier. The good thing is that it can be hosted on premise so no dependence on external services.</p>

            <p>Trello all the way for both issue and feature request tracking. Each column reflects a future app version and there’s also a “Possible” column for interesting but low-priority ideas. Then there is a card for every bug/feature and its comments are used to store the important details picked from customer emails.</p>

            <p>Disclaimer. We are at 6-digit MRR. There are two active contributors to the codebase: my partner and I, independently working on two separate parts of the app - data integration engine and UI/backend. We release <a href="https://support.etlworks.com/hc/en-us/sections/360004613093-Release-Notes">updates</a> once or twice a month, most of them are driven by customer requests.</p>
<p>We use Zendesk to track support tickets and we use <a href="https://feedback.etlworks.com/">Feature Upvote</a> for feature requests and public roadmap.</p>
<p>We don’t use any issue tracking tool for development. We used to have Kanban from GitLab but abandoned it about a year ago. I wouldn’t recommend it for every team, especially if you hire people to help with development, but it works pretty well for us, - a well-organized team of founders.</p>

            <p>GitHub issues + integrations. Can’t beat the “#” mention in commit-messages and pull requests.</p>
<p>We have a special Slack channel that is connected to “Github” Slack-app (or whatever its called?) that announces new issues coming in, status changes, comments being added, even when someone pushes a commit that references the issue. Very handy.</p>
<p>The issues in GitHub are being created from helpdesk tickets in <a href="https://www.jitbit.com/">our customer service app</a> that we’re actively dogfooding. Ticket received - “oh shit, looks like a bug” -  click-click - issue in GH <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>“Hate” is too strong a word for me, but I’ll answer anyway.</p>
<p>One thing I dislike about Jira is that I feel I need to take a course when I want to change <em>anything</em> about the way a project is configured.</p>
<p>eg. I recently wanted to add an additional status to the choice of issue statues in one project. I was confronted with “workflows” and “workflow schemes” and was never really sure if my changes would accidentally end up on other projects. So I decided didn’t really need the additional status after all…</p>
<p>This is my general experience when trying to configure just about anything in Jira.</p>

<p>I used to like Jira, long ago, when it was much better than the corporate alternatives I had been forced to use. But something went wrong over the years.</p>
<p>Now I tolerate it, only just.</p>
<p>I kind of liked the simplicity of FogBugz, but it seemed to have become abandonware a few years ago. I stopped using in 2014 because we exceeded the limits of the free plan and the paid plans at the time were remarkably expensive.</p>

            <p>I’m using BitBucket for free private git. Thus, I use their simple issue tracker which supports referring to issues in commit messages for auto-linking. It’s lightweight but has strengths that make it easy to build complex reports:</p>
<ul>
<li>a simple <span class="hashtag">#123</span> creates a link to that issue</li>
<li>linked issues like that are styled as struck-through when they are closed, so an Epic issue is easy to scan</li>
<li>attaching images is trivially easy</li>
<li>the URLs are stable and readable, good for copying into both code (as TODO) and discussions</li>
</ul>

            <p>I hate JIRA with a passion. I used to use FogBugz (or whatever it’s called this week), which was barely acceptable.</p>
<p>I recently switched to Linear (<a href="https://linear.app/">https://linear.app/</a>) and I think it is fantastic. The more I use it, the more I like it. I wish it had more features (like auto-linking GitHub commits to tasks based on task labels in commits), but even now I think it is really, really good. And it works very well as a mobile webapp on a phone, too.</p>
