    <title>Jobs By Inbox - Segmented startup jobs delivered to your inbox weekly</title>

    <description>Hi Everyone,

First off, thank you for taking the time to check out my project.

Jobs By Inbox is a newsletter service. I am scraping data from approximately 15 sites at the moment with more to come. That job data is then cleaned up and segmented into different areas of expertise (marketing, development, design, etc).

I found developers have easy pickings at websites that aggregate startup jobs, but marketers, customer service and other areas of a business get left out. To help with that I&#39;m working to build multiple data APIs that can then be automated to compile, clean and send out emails weekly with an aggregated list across hundreds of job boards.

If you&#39;d like to take a look: jobsbyinbox.com</description>
