    <title>Suggestions for legalese</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/suggestions-for-legalese/957</link>
    <description>Like 98% of the internet I&#39;m working on a SaaS product and, being a developer, I&#39;m very comfortable doing the technical part. However, before I can flip the switch and put it online I need things like Terms Of Service and a Privacy Policy and whatnot.

I&#39;m pretty sure I shouldn&#39;t randomly copy/paste this from another place so I was wondering where you guys sourced these documents from and, alternatively, if you have any recommendations on people who could draft these documents.

I&#39;m located in The Netherlands but I suppose this shouldn&#39;t matter :)</description>

            <p>Ah, that’s a good starting point! I would still have to find someone to review it though. Are there any “SaaS lawyers” out there?</p>

            <p>The <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/tos/">Wordpress Terms of Service</a> (Automattic), have been released under a Creative Commons license. I’ve heard that more than a few SaaS companies have based their TOS on this foundation.</p>
