    <description>Relaunch: EasyPromo - Find promotion opportunities for your business

Hey everyone! A few months ago I already posted here about my new project and since the feedback was quite good but I realized that my approach would be not optimal I refactored my idea and are currently building an MVP.  

However, I have created a small landing page already and would like to invite everyone who is looking for promotion opportunities (sponsored postings, partnerships, influencer marketing, etc.) And as a small gift, for your early interest, I would like to give you a curated list with 80 places where you to promote your business right now.

Here we go: [https://easypromo.io/](https://easypromo.io/)

Thx and cheers
