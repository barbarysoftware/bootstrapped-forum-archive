I have been planning a newsletter for our website visitors for YEARS.

Some of the reasons I didn&#39;t get around to it were:

 1. Didn&#39;t think I had good &quot;stuff&quot; for them
 2. Email distribution used to be complicated. (I tried sending it myself but email bounces were a pain). That&#39;s all changed in the last 5+ years.
 

But there are other possible reasons:

 1. Perhaps there&#39;s not value (return on investment)
  2. Don&#39;t have time.

Other reasons?</description>

            <p>On a similar subject to this, if you write a blog article do you do an email blast to your mailing list about it?</p>

            <p>I run a freemium Shopify app. My free plan shows all the available settings and functionality, and urges to upgrade when needed for what shops want to do. So I feel that already smooths onboarding to my paid plan.</p>
<p>Eventually I’ll have some drip email campaign about customer success stories but for the next 6 months or so I really need to focus everything on building out the app first. Conversion to paid is decent already and I have a list of real prospects waiting for certain features. Seems better ROI to focus on that first.</p>

            <p>pjc,</p>
<p>so you have some ideas of content that would be of interest to (and ideally reinforce your value proposition) to your customers?</p>
<p>Have you considered just writing one or two articles so that everyone who comes to your site can sign up and get those two?</p>
<p>That way you make your website <em>sticky</em>.</p>
<p>Or, do you have a website yet?</p>
