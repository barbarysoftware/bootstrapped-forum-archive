    <description>On an early episode of Bootstrapped there was a discussion of movies that Andrey watches while coding. Many of them I&#39;ve seen but this weekend I came across a list of some newer stuff about half of it I&#39;ve never heard of. So  I thought I&#39;d share.

FWIW, they link to the different video sources you can find these, and The Startup Kids says it&#39;s only on iTunes, but I found it on Amazon Prime. It also has the founder of one of the startups I was in, Loic LeMeur of Seesmic.

UPDATE: I went back and looked up the podcast episode, it was episode 5. They are all linked in the show notes: http://bootstrapped.fm/bootstrapped-episode-5-lets-all-go-to-the-movies/</description>

            <p>That movie came out at the worst possible time ever – right around 9/11. I totally related to the plight of the 2 characters as I was going through a similar thing myself up north in Montreal. The good news is that their friendship endured and they went on to create other successful businesses together. Friendship over money – always…</p>

            <p>I liked <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0256408/">Startup.com</a>, even though they failed. Dot-com excess, irrational exuberance, and a cautionary tale of what business can do to friendship.</p>

            <p>I watched an amazing one last night. “Inventing David Geffen” Holy cow! This guy is amazing. I knew his name but had no idea of his story.</p>

<p>He grew up in Brooklyn and is now worth $6 billion. Just like <a class="mention" href="/u/andrey">@andrey</a>.</p>

            <p>Ah nice, I’ll definitely be checking some of these out. Maybe me and <a class="mention" href="/u/andrey">@andrey</a> should pick one and talk about it on the show.</p>
