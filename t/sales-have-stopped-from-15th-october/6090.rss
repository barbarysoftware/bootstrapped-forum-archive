    <title>Sales have stopped from 15th october</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/sales-have-stopped-from-15th-october/6090</link>
    <description>Hello,

I sell a software product facecropjet[.]com .Basically its a tool for detecting and cropping out faces from photos.The sales have completely dried up since OCT 15th.Some users had reported crashes and a few bugs,it has been sorted.I don&#39;t understand why the product wont sell.

The traffic is almost the same.Did not encounter this issue last year.

Kindly advice</description>

            <p>I’d do the following if this happened to my desktop app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check Google Analytics or Google Search Console to see if my traffic has stopped.</li>
<li>Check my downloads/day stats to see if downloads had stopped</li>
<li>Check if my software’s “your trial is over - pay now please” mechanism had stopped working</li>
<li>Check if my payment process is working</li>
<li>Check if “[my product] crack” or a rival, pirate “buy [my product]” page was outranking my own product pages in Google.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once I’d identified where the problem lay, I would then work out how to fix the problem.</p>

            <p>Maybe some free alternative popped up recently? Have you checked the Google keywords tool to see how people find your product and which other product they find?</p>

            <p>Their  primary mode of communication is email,Phone is just secondary.No one bothers to call as our sales volume is pretty low <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

            <p>I see the phone number listed on your website for order queries is FastSpring’s number. Does that work well for you? I don’t have a number listed on my website (I’m a sole trader) so this might be a good alternative? Got me thinking.</p>

            <p>How many sales there were before they stopped? I’d suggest buying your own product (not a test order, make a real purchase with your credit card), just to make sure the sales process is functional.</p>
<p>I also suggest renaming your setup file from generic “setup.exe” to something else (like your product name) and getting a code sign certificate.</p>
