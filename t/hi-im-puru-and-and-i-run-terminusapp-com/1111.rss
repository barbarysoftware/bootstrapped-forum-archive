    <description>Hi everyone,

I am Puru and I am bootstrapping Terminus (www.terminusapp.com). It&#39;s a SaaS app that helps marketers build and manage UTM tracking URLs. 

For the past 7-8 months, I have been working on Terminus during weekends and weeknights. It has been very exhausting. But I finally got my first paying customer this week. I still have a long way to go.

I live in the San Francisco bay area. If anyone wants to meet for a cup of coffee, I would definitely love to do that.

I am glad to have found this forum and see so many experienced and well-known bootstrappers here.

Also, it looks like quite a few people from here are going to Microconf 2014 in LV. I am going as well and I look forward to meeting some of you there.
