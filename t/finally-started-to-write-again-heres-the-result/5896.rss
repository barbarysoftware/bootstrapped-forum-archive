    <description>Hi Bootstrappers,

I finally, finally, finally wrote another article (thanks for the push, GDPR!) after 8 months of hiatus. 

You all know these funny &quot;GDPR-consent&quot; emails and the German DoD had their very own take on how to get reader&#39;s consent. 

There are a few lessons about email user experience one can learn from that. So here&#39;s the full article: 

https://www.saasemailmarketing.net/articles/email-user-experience-butchered/

Any feedback is welcome!

Cheers,
Christoph</description>

            <p>Oh so you need social proof?</p>
<p>Well, that’s easy - here’s your first user testimonial.</p>
<p>“Just what I needed! Getting actionable data from Google Analytics is a nightmare. Highlights gave me at least 4-5 solid ideas on how to improve different pages on my website.” - Christoph Engelhardt, Author of the SaaS Email Marketing Handbook</p>

<p>Wow, tremendous feedback Christian! Thanks for testing it out. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>We’re in the process of launching a new LP this week. I’ll try and squeeze in the changes for “identifying and”. Social proof is a little tricky this early though. Working on it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Great points about the pricing. We’re pretty early-stage so all feedback is good feedback. We’d like to be able to have a <em>valuable</em> freemium model. Maybe that’s why the pricing sounds too generous!</p>
<p>Thank you, really appreciated!</p>

            <p>Hi Etienne,</p>
<p>I think there is value in a tool like highlights. It’s not straight-forward for most people to understand what their analytics are trying to tell them.<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/thedavecollins">@TheDaveCollins</a> does a wonderful job in his videos to teach it for Google Analytics/Search Console/SEO, but having a tool do it for me sounds amazing.</p>
<p>Landing page:<br>
I think the header is a bit too long and I’d test removing the “identifying and” because the real value is in fixing it.<br>
I’d also test adding testimonials to the page. There is little in the way of social proof (only the “integrations” somewhat count towards that).</p>
<p>Pricing:<br>
Have you tested this pricing or are you super-early-stage?<br>
My gut feeling is that this is clearly a B2B product and for more sophisticated customers. As such $99/mo is a reasonable price.<br>
However, I think the free plan offers way too much. The benefit of going premium isn’t clear to me.<br>
I’d test dropping the unlimited tracking from the free plan. Instead go with something like “10 results each month” or so.<br>
I pay more than $100 for Ahrefs and on some reports they only show me 10 results until I pay &gt;$200 - so you can pull that off on the free plan <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Tool:<br>
I wasn’t able to connect Drip and I don’t have Mailchimp, so I only tested Google Analytics.</p>
<p>The suggestions are good - maybe I should really look into optimizing things.</p>
<p>Some pages are double-reported (difference in parameters, <code>/</code> vs. <code>?ref=quuu</code>).</p>

            <p>Hahaha! I <em>love</em> the German military style! It is <em>so much in line</em> with the existing public image of them, those stern Teutonic warriors. Links? Links are for pussies! Say danke for not having to run 10km over defense lines in a gas mask to sign your consent!</p>
<p>Regarding your post tho: it is a bit under-performing for scanners like me. I do not read carefully, I scan, and most people probably do the same. In you “Improving the usability of your emails” part I’d suggest to highlight - either with colour, or blockquote (my fav), or bullet-points the key takeaways, so even if I scan I’d notice and remember those.</p>
