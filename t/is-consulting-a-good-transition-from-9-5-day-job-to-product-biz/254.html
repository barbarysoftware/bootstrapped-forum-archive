          <p>I work a fairly standard day job as a software developer, and I am currently planning my own business in my free time.  My goal is to grow my business to a full time income as quick as possible, since I cannot see myself sustaining 2 jobs indefinitely.  I am risk-adverse, in that I don’t wan to quit my job without having replaced the income, but I think this puts me on a slower path from the start.</p>
<p>I hear a lot about people transitioning from consulting to products, and I’m wondering why this is.  Do people choose consulting because they think they will get a certain amount of freedom, then realize that the <em>real</em> freedom lies in products?  Or are there enough advantages in consulting to make it a good step for bootstrappers building their own product business?</p>
<p>I don’t have experience consulting, so my feeling is that I’m better off sticking with the day job and continuing my bootstrapping exploits on the side.  But I’m wondering If I may be better off moving to consulting/product biz rather than 9-5/product biz.</p>
<p>For those of you who have done either, I would love to hear your take.</p>
<ul>
<li>Would you do it the same way again?</li>
<li>Pros and Cons of consulting vs. 9-5 employee. (while bootstrapping)</li>
<li>What does it take to ramp up to a decent consulting income? (maybe $5K/month)</li>

          <p>The advantage for us of consulting was that we could essentially treat our product as another client and assign time to it. As time went on it just became a bigger client! That said, I think having the product and really wanting to spend all of our time on it did start to make the client work quite frustrating.</p>
<p>If you are working 9-5 for someone else it is going to be harder to develop a product in the same way that we did, unless you can negotiate to work part time as your product starts to provide an income.</p>

          <p>Having done both, and in this particular order, I would probably do it roughly the same way again.<br>
There are 2 main reasons for this: time management, and choice of clients.</p>
<p>Running any kind of business will have a non-trivial learning curve, and especially for people coming from a technical background, getting the fundamentals down will require a lot of reading, and experimenting. Time, however, is never something you have -it’s something you actively make, and claw out from other activities.<br>
Consulting allows you to dynamically balance learning / experimentation against client requirements within reason.</p>
<p>Choice of clients is a great conceptual shortcut for killing two birds with one stone: by consulting either for startups, or established businesses, you can bill for some of the required 10000 hours to learn the skill of entrepreneurship; and furthermore do active customer development with people living, and breathing business problems -some of which might be malleable to software solutions.</p>
<p>The greatest barriers to consulting is lining up clients, closing deals, managing expectations, and getting paid. Read a little, and practice a lot: I’d recommend Getting Started in Consulting by Alan Weiss, and actively sending 1-2 qualified sales proposals every weekend for the next 2 months. Once you close your first client, you can get a feel for what it takes to survive on consulting alone.</p>

          <p>Just to cover all the options:</p>
<p>There is a third way. The one I’m following now.</p>
<p>Consulting can bring in a lot of money, and give a lot of free time, too. But it is also very stressful since you’re always on a look out for the next client or your cash flow will dry up. You at first may get less time and less money than working full time 9-5. You may have troubles with client paying, too.</p>
<p>I’m doing contracting via agencies, and outsource my future products.</p>
<p>I have to cut the agencies about 20-30% what they charge to the client, but there are benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The revenue is 2-3x bigger than FTE (I get ~$100/hr to my business account), and you can write-off all kind of business-related stuff (including subcontractors)</li>
<li>Agencies never late with pay check, even when the client is</li>
<li>Minimal engagement is 6mo+, typical 1 yr+, non-stop</li>
<li>I almost never have a down-time, agencies book me some time before the previous contract ends</li>
<li>I get to work with good-paying companies where I wouldn’t have a chance as an independent consultant, because I simply do not know anyone over there</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I take that extra income and channel it into developing my future products. I do it via oDesk, where you can find a great developer in a sub-20 range somewhere in Ukraine or Philippines.</p>
<p>I spend about an hour a day after my kids are asleep to check the progress and give the directions. I spend a few hours every weekend to do more substantial work (e.g. mockups). A contractor typically puts in about 20 hours a week (at $10 to $20 range), so the product gets some full 30 hrs/wk, something I couldn’t have done for long if I were a consultant.</p>
<p>It may be not the fastest way, but it fits my situation better.</p>

          <p>Consulting typically pays 3-4 times what a day job would per hour, so in theory you’d be able to cover your expenses while working a quarter of the time on something non-product related.  I say in theory because in practice most people I know who have done this end up under billing time (and working the same amount or more then FTE) or they realize they are making 3-4 times what their already lucrative job paid and start enjoying that, and never get around to a product.</p>
<p>I think consulting is a great way to come up with a product if you don’t have one.  You’ll often find a unsolved problem that is a huge opportunity.</p>

          <p>I have done both – starting Catch the Best right after starting consulting, and starting Honeybadger while working a day job, and there are pros and cons both ways.</p>
<p>The primary advantage of consulting was having the flexibility to work on the product anytime (since I do all my consulting remote), so you could take a support/partnership call, handle a server emergency, etc., whenever you wanted.</p>
<p>The primary advantage of the day job approach was having a stable workload and salary so I didn’t have to worry as much about client work being crazy for X amount of time, which would keep me from consistently working on the product.</p>
<p>I will say, though, that it depends on the nature of the product you are building.  Honeybadger got to the point (since it’s ops-heavy and people depend on it being responsive 24/7) that I couldn’t keep the day job while giving Honeybadger what it needed, so I left the day job and now fill in part of my income with consulting.  So give that part some consideration in your deliberations.</p>
<p>Since you don’t have experience consulting, I would say seriously consider staying where you are while you build your product, unless (as rfctr mentioned) you have a consistent way you know you can get consulting work.  It can big a <strong>big</strong> ball of stress to chase after the next paycheck. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

          <p>I’ve never technically worked a “real” job (except for that 7 week period nearly a decade ago…a moment of weakness <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">), so I can’t speak on the transition itself, but I can say that consulting is a pretty great way to sustain you while you build your own business.</p>
<p>The single greatest reason is this: <strong>flexibility</strong>.</p>
<p>You can do whatever the heck you want. I don’t think typical 9-5ers get that. What. Ever. You. Want.</p>
<p>You’re free to bust your butt for a couple of months and rake in a ton of cash from clients and then take the next couple of months off to focus 100% on your own thing. You’re free to charge clients whatever you want. You’re free to use your clients as a way to get paid to learn new things. You’re free to sell clients the product you’re working on. Etc etc.</p>
<p>Sure, there are downsides to consulting. There are downsides to being an entrepreneur. But the flexibility that being self-employed brings really cannot be overstated. It’s the perfect setup.</p>

          <p>Thanks for all the great responses!  You sure make consulting sound like a good idea, I think I will dive a little deeper to see if its really a good fit for me.  So where do I start looking for opportunities?</p>
<p>I don’t live in a big city, so I doubt I’ll find much locally unless I can find a small business niche.  Remote work is probably my best bet.  Though, I don’t want to throw myself into a pool of low-bidding freelancers … is there any good resource for high quality part time gigs?</p>
<p>I have a feeling my best bet is to network with people I know, build a reputation, etc.  However If this doesn’t work so well, I may not come out ahead of where I would be at with FTE, since I’ll be spending my current spare time on building a consulting business rather than my product business.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

          <p>I’ve lived in big cities and small cities and 99% of my clients are never were where I lived. So, location certainly doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to hit up job boards (not job sites where you have to send in a resume…“gig” type places).</p>
<p>A few I’d recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://authenticjobs.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://authenticjobs.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jobs.37signals.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://jobs.37signals.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Those are less about low bidding and more about connecting with the person posting the job to see if you’d be a good fit.</p>
<p>Stay away from Elance and the like. Hit up those links I mentioned to get some initial work going and then grow from there.</p>

          <p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="../../u/shpigford.html">@Shpigford</a>. Like him, I’ve never had a “real job” as programmer so I cannot comment on the transition part but I can tell you that consulting while trying to build your own product can feel a bit like insanity if you are risk averse like you mentioned.  (Guessing you have a wife and kids, correct??)</p>
<p>There have been MANY times I have considered going to work for a regular paycheck but also like <a class="mention" href="../../u/shpigford.html">@Shpigford</a>, I value the flexibility too much.  However, as backward as it may sound given my own choice, unless you honestly don’t mind a bumpy ride, my advice would be to keep your job until you can afford not to.</p>
<p>Something I’d like to add is that you could also consider building a portfolio of sites that kick off enough passive income to allow you to work on your product.  I combine that with periodic client-work to afford time to work on my bigger objectives.</p>
