    <description>What did you accomplish in July?

- I did sucessfully capitalize on the Windows 10 launch (and the new Microsoft browser) by collecting leads with a free tool ([DoesItWorkOnEdge.com][1])
- This has resulted in a ~25&amp; growth in revenue :smile:

            <p>I seem to have gotten one new customer. I can’t be 100% sure until after the 30-day trial is over but all the right signs are there. It’s probably not obvious but one customer per month is a pretty good number for me at this stage.</p>
<p>And the more gratifying part of what’s been going on is that my sales funnel that’s been in place since late May is continuing to function as hoped and expected. It’s a wonderful feeling after years of mostly frustration.</p>
