<p>No ads. Twitter is <em>social</em>. Think mini-blog plus . . . this site, really. Interactive.</p>
<p>(It sounds like you’re doing more than fine without, just saying: it’s there, and waiting!)</p>

            <p>Good read/reminder. Funny, how I know having a family/friend go through my UI would insightful, but a piece of me doesn’t want to know how bad it is. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<p>Also, love the company name “buzzwordcompliant LLC”</p>

            <p>Twitters seems mostly a write-only medium.</p>
<p>I tried some paid Twitter ads for my training course. Unimpressed with the results.</p>
<p>I announced a PerfectTablePlan Twitter account to 3k newsletter subscribers. 0 follows.</p>
<p>Auto following people in the hope they will follow you back just seems creepy.</p>
<p>Maybe I am just a dinosaur who doesn’t ‘get’ Twitter.</p>
<p>But Twitter does have its uses. I got some help with technical problem yesterday within an hour of posting it on Twitter.</p>
<p>YMMV obviously.</p>

            <p>Nevermind support - I’m really surprised that you aren’t doing marketing over Twitter as it would seem really ripe for that (just follow every person who lists ‘wedding planner’ in their Twitter description).</p>
<p>Also, to be clear, for Twitter ‘support’ usually just means being nice and then asking them to email.</p>

            <p>It’s a good article. Personally I don’t use Twitter for support though.</p>
<p>Support is an area where a microISV really has an advantage over BigCo.</p>
