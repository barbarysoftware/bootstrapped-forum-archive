            <p>Thanks for the info about your use case. Definitely helps focus my perspective and frame the benefits. That was effectively my own user case when I started building it. Non-technical partner in another project that wanted to help as much as possible, but wasn’t sure how.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay. Updated my profile with my real name. Also rolled out a bunch of updates, bug fixes, clarification (hopefully?) and newly simplified plans as well.</p>
<p>So far, the most prevalent use case seems to be small teams using <a href="http://OverLook.io" rel="nofollow noopener">OverLook.io</a> to help facilitate non-technical folks providing meaningful, actionable feedback by following a pre-defined set of steps (read: tests).</p>
<p>Thanks for all the feedback so far. Happy to hear more of it or any questions.</p>

            <p>I actually needed something exactly like the but feature set vs the pricing is a little too expensive for me.  Unfortunately I just left the project last week so I can’t use this right now.</p>
<p>Right now your pricing tiers are simple limits on existing features and that sort of turns the developer in me off.  I mean I know that having 10x the rows of data doesn’t cost 10x the price.  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Also don’t like how the pricing will sort of stunt my productivity one day when I’m furiously working and then come up to a limit.  I’d be a lot more interested to pay $30 for unlimited everything and then $60 for unlimited everything and trello/basecamp integration.</p>
<p>To give you a better idea of my use case I had two non-technical co-founders who didn’t “actively participate” in the development process.  The QA load seriously impacted how much I could code because I’d also have to test.  Asking them to test was awkward and they never managed to really help me out.</p>
<p>They’d ignore the software for months, not understand how it works and it would seriously impact sales and marketing.</p>
<p>I was looking for a product like this to not only get them more involved in the QA dev cycle but also sort of give them a window into how the software works.  I don’t think managing the QA process is the main benefit of the software, thats boring and if you have a QA department you already have some gigantic bug tracker you’re using.  I think getting other people easily involved in the QA process is the main benefit.</p>
<p>If my next venture succeeds I’d use this tool with a cheap VA, other subcontractors, non-technical co-founders or other non-techs I bring on instead of making them up to an unfriendly bug tracker or making them follow a google doc.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s the first thing that came to my mind as well. I can see where it could work but I think most people’s first impression will look at it in the right context. Perhaps this will make it memorable?</p>
<p>I’d also consider changing your forum name here. I believe this discussion board is about the people, not the products.</p>
<p>Do you go by Over or Look? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>I just realised: You haven’t given an introduction about who you are.</p>
<p>The Show and Tell forum intro does say that you need to have <a href="http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/what-is-show-tell/614">participated in a few discussions</a> before you can post. I don’t know if this is because of a bug, or the rules changed when the forum moved to the official discourse hosting.</p>

            <p>Seems like a nice idea.</p>
<p>Three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I’d change the name. I don’t want to overlook any test cases. I guess you mean in the sense of ‘have a view from above’. I don’t think that meaning works in this context. For me, overlook + testcases means I’ve missed test cases.</li>
<li>Does it integrate with [my favourite bug tracker or test tool]? I’m not going to use a second. Have you considered making this an add-on to an existing tool? For example, this might work as a plugin for Jira. Or a Jira plugin for your browser.</li>
<li>Having a live demo is great, but the live demo didn’t really help me understand the tool.</li>
</ol>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback. During the web development process, developers, testers, product owners, and others regularly “check the app for bugs”. There is little process around doing so. <a href="http://Overlook.io" rel="nofollow noopener">Overlook.io</a> provides structure for that process to make sure the different use cases are covered every time someone runs through a test plan, versus relying strictly on memory for what to check, for example.</p>
