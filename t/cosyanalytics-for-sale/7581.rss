            <p>Actually the story is very funny. I have a notebook where I put ideas when they appear. And I had such idea written down for a sunny day in the future.</p>
<p>One day I noticed the same thing is on sale at <a href="http://sideprojectors.com">sideprojectors.com</a> and I said ‘I want it!’. The price was $20K, I offered 10K and we agreed for 16K. I didn’t had that amount at the moment and we agreed to wait for few months until I have all the funds. When that moment came the guy refused to sale. Then I sat at my but and learned NodeJS for a week and made the same functionality for one month and polished for another.</p>
<p>The story goes with the same guy asking me a few months later do I still want to buy it, but at that point in time I was also starting to think isn’t it a good idea to sell it just like him. And this all ended this week.</p>
