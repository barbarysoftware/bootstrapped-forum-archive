    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Patrick Pohler from Anecka</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-patrick-pohler-from-anecka/154</link>
    <description>Hello! I&#39;m Patrick Pohler and I&#39;m the founder of [Anecka][1]. I do web development and mobile web development for small businesses, interactive agencies, and startups. I have a nicely growing services business that is growingI&#39;m also working on a few products for freelancers &amp; consultants including:

 - [MarvelShare][2] : Share accounts, software licenses &amp; project info with your clients automatically!
 - PDF Press : (Anecka.com/pdf_press) Save your ExpressionEngine® HTML Templates to PDFs with no monthly fee!

I quit my corporate job three years ago not sure exactly what I wanted to do, just knowing that I wanted to start building a business for myself. I had the chance to work at some really great places as a developer but like clockwork after 2 years I&#39;d end up quitting. 

I&#39;m working as a consultant to help pay the bills while I develop product ideas (which is really what I want to be doing), it&#39;s been challenging. As a developer I bring a lot of pre-convinced bias to the table and I find myself challenging a lot of assumptions I once held. It&#39;s not enough to build a product, you have to learn how to talk to people about it in a way that connects with their needs and desires. It&#39;s a great ride and I&#39;m learning a lot from the boostrap/micro community.

I live in Columbus, OH with my wife Haley and a fat cat named Bill. Always willing to chat about homebrewing, software, startups and aviation.
