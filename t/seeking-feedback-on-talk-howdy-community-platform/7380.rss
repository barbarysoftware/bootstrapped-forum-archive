    <title>Seeking Feedback on Talk Howdy: Community Platform</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/seeking-feedback-on-talk-howdy-community-platform/7380</link>
    <description>Hey y&#39;all! My startup, Talk Howdy, is currently seeking beta testers/feedback on our product and messaging. We&#39;d love to hear your thoughts. 

**Elevator pitch:** Talk Howdy is a platform for finding and creating online communities: connect to people with shared interests through small group, virtual meetups.

**Lander copy:** 
*DISCOVER A COMMUNITY*
Communities are a place to communicate about shared interests with certain people. You can create a community for anything - your alumni group, your book club, or your underground society.

*DISCUSS WHAT INTERESTS YOU*
Attend virtual meetups with your community using our integrated video platform. Use the discussion board to pose topics for conversation, share your thoughts, and connect with community members.

*ONE STREAMLINED PLATFORM*
Say goodbye to the days of using multiple platforms to get connected. Stay in touch with your crew all through your community homepage on Howdy.

Thanks!</description>

            <p>Hello, I like your idea. Economy is moving towards community related business.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but think about Facebook groups and Reddit. I’d like to know what you plan to have as a differentiator.</p>
<p>Also, it would be amazing to get a link, since I wasn’t able to find your website when googling.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
