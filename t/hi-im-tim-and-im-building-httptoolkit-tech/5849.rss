    <title>Hi! I&#39;m Tim, and I&#39;m building HttpToolkit.tech</title>

    <description>Hi there! I&#39;m bootstrapping a new project, and this forum looks like a great place to share ideas and meet people going through the same.

Right now, I&#39;m building a new side project called **HTTP Toolkit: [httptoolkit.tech](https://httptoolkit.tech)**.

It&#39;s a suite of tools for developers working with HTTP, to debug &amp; explore &amp; rapidly prototype on all things HTTP.

I&#39;ve just finished the first version of the landing page - I&#39;d love some feedback if you have some :smiley:

I&#39;m bootstrapping this of course - I&#39;ve got a full time software development job at a startup, which is funding exploring this, and has actually been really useful for learning a lot of basic marketing and strategy. Full time work makes time management difficult, but in the early days I think that can actually be useful, to focus the mind on getting the smallest possible poc built. So far so good!</description>

            <p>The design is nice. I would focus some more on the wording, too…</p>
<p>For example, you have:</p>
<p>HTTP TOOLKIT<br>
Debug, test &amp; change how your ___ communicates.<br>
BEAUTIFUL, OPEN‑SOURCE &amp; CROSS‑PLATFORM<br>
HTTP PROXY, ANALYZER AND CLIENT.</p>
<p>That’s the first thing I read. You have to hook me here or I’m outta there.</p>
<p>On a purely emotional level, which we know people buy into more often than on the rational, I would prefer wording such as:</p>
<p>HTTP TOOLKIT<br>
Your personal HTTP workshop</p>
<p>…etc, – something which immediately grabs me on a more personal level. My workshop? What tools do you have? etc, maybe even run with that theme and spread it across your design. I think stuff like that very much helps your product stand out with more personality and from every other dry software product landing page.</p>
<p>Course… just my 2c <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> split testing would go a long way.</p>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/stevemcleod">@SteveMcLeod</a>! This is easily the most useful feedback I’ve had - getting detailed feedback like this beyond ‘it looks great’ is really hard <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">. I’ll start looking at that asap.</p>

            <p>I think this is a good landing page. It passes the “can I tell within 5 seconds whether this product is for me” test.</p>
<p>Even though you haven’t released the product I think you should add pricing. This answers the second question most visitors have - is this product within my budget. At the very least, allow people to tell if it has a basic plan for less than $50/month, or whether it has “call us” pricing, aimed at the enterprise. Pricing sends a signal.</p>
<p>Finally, I assume this is a desktop product. You don’t mention that on the landing page, as far as I can tell. I suggest indicating this somewhere in your copy.</p>
