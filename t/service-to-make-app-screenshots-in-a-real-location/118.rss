    <title>Service to make app screenshots in a real location</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/service-to-make-app-screenshots-in-a-real-location/118</link>
    <description>[PlaceIt][1] is a service (free, I think) that takes your app screenshots, and makes an image out of them that makes it look like your app is running on a real phone, in a real location.

Should be of some use to mobile devs.
