    <title>Scheduling Tweets?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/scheduling-tweets/944</link>
    <description>People have been lovely in terms of helping me promote my new book, but one thing that really surprised me was the number of folk who said, &quot;I&#39;ve scheduled a tweet about it&quot;. I&#39;ve never scheduled a tweet in my life, my Twitter account ranges from business stuff, to web dev, to photos of my cat as and when I feel like it.

I just wondered what other people were using to do this, is [Buffer][1] the top choice if I were to want to schedule Tweets about my cat on a regular basis?

<p>This. This. This.</p>
<p>I have a couple of actual real-life friends who auto-tweet “11 things that your cat knows about business” and the like - they are not long for my timeline.</p>
<p>Be more signal, less noise. A little self-promotion is fine. But be a human if your face is on your account.</p>

            <p>I also use <a href="https://hootsuite.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">HootSuite</a> and love it.</p>
<p>I had chosen them over Buffer because I’m a “heavy tweet scheduler” (if there is such a term) and need to be able to upload a bulk of tweets to be scheduled. In one account, I have tweets scheduled out a full year.</p>
<p>Back when I evaluated these two services, Buffer didn’t have the ability to bulk-schedule lots of tweets. (It looks like they do now though.) Also, if you’re going to purchase a premium plan, HootSuite is a bit cheaper ($8.99/mo as opposed to $10/mo).</p>

            <p>You guys should check out Sproutsocial. <a href="http://sproutsocial.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://sproutsocial.com/</a>. It’s an awesome service for scheduling and much easier to use than Hottsuite in my opinion for my startup The Coder Factory (<a href="https://thecoderfactory.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://thecoderfactory.com/</a>). But yes, it’s also important not to spoon feed the same tweets over and over again with no interaction.</p>

            <p>I schedule tweets occasionally through Buffer.  Usually it’s about a new blog post or some other news item that I want to tweet out but it’s later in the night.  I schedule these for the next morning so I more people will see them and I’ll actually be awake to interact with them.</p>

            <p>You can schedule tweets using the Twitter Ads interface at <a href="http://ads.twitter.com/">http://ads.twitter.com/</a><br>
Anyone can signup and you won’t have to give them your credit card to schedule tweets.</p>
<p>Once you sign up click on the Tweet icon and selected Scheduling, relatively easy and unlikely to get shutdown considering it is Twitter and all.</p>

            <p>+1 for Hootsuite.  I personally don’t schedule tweets but my writer <a href="http://twitter.com/teenormous" rel="nofollow noopener">does</a>.  Scheduling makes it easy to make sure you have regular content, and allows my writer to just do it all at the beginning of the week.</p>
<p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="/u/simon">@Simon</a> - the time of day is a factor in visibility of tweets.  Also, with Hootsuite you can post the same message to Facebook, G+ etc.</p>

            <p>I’ve gone through periods where I’ve pre-written a whole series of Twitter posts. It definitely helps in this case to spread them out and schedule them.</p>
<p>More people are going to see your Tweet (or Facebook post, or blog post) at 10 AM on a Tuesday rather than 2 AM on a Saturday.</p>
<p>I use Twuffer for tweet scheduling.</p>

            <p>Agree with not automating too much- your readers will see you are just throwing out tweets with no interaction. That’s how big fortune 500 type companies behave, do we really want to emulate them?</p>
<p>That said, automating tweets is a good idea if done very occasionally. There are plugins that will automatically tweet and FB your blog, for example. That way, readers who don’t subscribe via email/Rss will know about your latest post. I don’t use this service, but I have seen people use it. These were people who were interacting a lot, so the occasional automated tweet didn’t matter.</p>
<p>I’d use Tweetdeck. For a long time, I preferred Hootsuite, but then they started harassing me (logging me off for no reason, forcing me to login constantly, changing the UI etc), and I decided I’d had enough of them. Now I stick to the default web UI from Twitter, or Tweetdeck.</p>

            <p>You don’t need a service if all you’re doing is scheduling a tweet. Tweetdeck will let you schedule any tweet, as long as you’re not attaching an image.</p>

            <p>Scheduling tweets can be handy for a busy person, but I’d be wary of overdoing it.</p>
<p>There is a UX “expert” in my local area who tweets the same thing day after day after day. That picture of Don Norman at an event she organized? She auto-tweets it several times per week. it’s ridiculous.</p>
<p>It’s fine to automate some tweets, but remember that the people who are reading are <em>not</em> automatons.</p>
<p>Personally I think the beauty of Twitter is its instant and direct mode of communication. When I sense that someone I’m following is more robot than human, I unfollow.</p>

            <p>I use HootSuite as well, I’m not a regular twitterer with my business account, so it helps to just sit down on Mondays and write a bunch of tweets and have them scheduled.  Make sure you have the mobile app with you though so you can cancel a scheduled tweet, there is absolutely nothing worse than some tragedy happening (school shooting, plane crash, etc…), and your business it tweeting something glib.</p>
