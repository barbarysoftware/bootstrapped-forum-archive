            <p>I do this too, at the beginning of each month. I don’t mind doing it.</p>
<p>I find the process of manually copying data from ChartMogul, Google Analytics, and our admin dashboard into Google Sheets helpful for getting the info to stick in my head.</p>

            <p>I’ve got profitwell set up, but I also want to look at stats from google analytics, plus some custom stats we track for our apps. So this is about have a record for all of them in one place.</p>
<p>I could be convinced that I am doing it wrong, but for now this is how we do it!</p>

            <p>Have you looked at apps like Profitwell or Chartmogul for metrics overviews? I think one of those might be more efficient than having a VA update spreadsheets manually.</p>

            <p>Good episode guys. This has been on my mind this year. It seems every few weeks I lose a full day to customer support and admin, and still don’t get to the bottom of my to-do list. Those tasks hanging over me, even if not urgent, then add a mental load and start burning me out.</p>
<p>It’s still a work in progress, but some things I have done so far</p>
<ul>
<li>Got my accountants to start doing bookkeeping for me</li>
<li>I’m using receiptbank for my receipts, that can automatically get receipts for some vendors (aws I know works). For others I set rules in Gmail to tag and forward invoices directly to them and mark as read. Also, mobile app for coffees etc.</li>
<li>I’ve hired a va to update a bunch of spreadsheets for me each month. I use these to track key metrics for each app, not sure if there is a better approach but for now it’s manual but I no longer do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above has freed up a bunch of time. Otherwise at least once a month I was spending a day or more on this stuff. Or just not doing it. It’s an ongoing process though!</p>

            <p>I’d love to get someone from Paddle’s leadership onto the podcast. I could get them to explain the pros and cons, with a slightly combative albeit friendly host.</p>

            <p>One method to minimize tax admin is to use a reseller like <a href="http://paddle.com">paddle.com</a> instead of just a payment processor like stripe.  This reduces my VAT tax handling burden substantially.</p>

            <p>I had this a bit of ambiguous idea to try to start a movement to get all the vendors to implement vendors to add the billing into their Zapier integration or just plain webhooks  so you can really automate all of this.</p>
