    <title>Assuring customers that you - a bootstrapper - are worth paying</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/assuring-customers-that-you-a-bootstrapper-are-worth-paying/7007</link>
    <description>I read this question on Twitter:

&gt; QUESTION: when you&#39;re considering paying for a service from an indie/bootstrapped SaaS - what do you consider in regards to the company behind it, before opening that digital wallet of yours? or, do you even think about the company behind it as a factor in your decision?

Turning the question around, how do you assure would be customers that they should open the wallet and pay you money?</description>

            <p>In answering the original question: having a complete website is a strong signal as <a class="mention" href="/u/dmitry">@Dmitry</a> mentioned (home, features, pricing, about, &amp; docs).</p>
<p>I’m also inclined to overlook website completeness if the pricing is clear and a free trial is immediately available to explore the product.</p>
<p>To that end, I’m working on a frictionless signup/onboarding flow so users can receive tangible value quickly. My hypothesis is that doing that well will make it simple to fork over a little cash.</p>

            <p>In all seriousness I tell would be customers that there is nothing even close to what we provide for what we ask to pay (and we are not exactly cheap).</p>

            <p>I would say the vast majority of people don’t even consider that the product might be coming from an indie/bootstrapped company. They don’t even know what that means. The only people who consider it are other bootstrappers or big companies (never get fired for buying IBM/Microsoft/AWS).</p>

            <p>Having a good web site is the most important thing: detailed information about the product, professional web site look - no typos, no grammar errors, nice design, recent news showing that the product/company is alive and in active development, money back guarantee etc. Offering a demo/trial and a product that is good and does what is promised also help a lot.</p>
