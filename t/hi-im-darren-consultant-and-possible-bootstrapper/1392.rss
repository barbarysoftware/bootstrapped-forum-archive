    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Darren, consultant and possible bootstrapper</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-darren-consultant-and-possible-bootstrapper/1392</link>
    <description>Hi,

I&#39;ve been consulting for 12 years and developing web applications for 15. I&#39;ve been getting more and more interested in bootstrapping something myself over the past 2 years and in the past 6 months I&#39;ve started fleshing things out in earnest. My day job is running a boutique PHP dev consultancy comprising of me and two full-time developers.

I got to this forum from Rachel Andrew&#39;s (great) The Profitable Side Project Handbook, via a reference to the podcast (which I&#39;m now subscribed to). I&#39;ve also been following Justin Jackson&#39;s Product People and Christopher Hawkins&#39; Chasing Product.

I have at least one idea for a phone app that will add value to an established service but am now mulling over options for some initial content marketing / audience building / smaller first product after coming across the concept only a few weeks ago.

I&#39;ve a blog at [Bealers.com][1] that I&#39;ll be possibly evolving to focus more on my target audience and a couple of months back I started the [Backendy.com][2] podcast. The latter I started without an eye on audience building, I just had the idea one day and thought I&#39;d JFDI. 

Cheers

Darren Beale(rs)

<p>Yes, I liked that book too. I wasn’t sure if spending $39 for something I already knew would be worth it, but it totally was. Read the book twice</p>
