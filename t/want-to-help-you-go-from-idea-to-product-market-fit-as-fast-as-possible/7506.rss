    <title>Want to help you go from idea to product-market fit as fast as possible</title>

    <description>Hey bootstrappers!

My goal is to help you go from idea to product-market fit so you can raise funding if you want or keep on bootstrapping.  I feel like my goal is to help you reduce risk of working on the wrong thing.

Currently I work at a tech startup as a conversion rate optimization but the machines are coming for my job :slight_smile: 

I&#39;m look forward to seeing what this is all about.</description>
