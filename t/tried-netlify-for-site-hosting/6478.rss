    <title>Tried Netlify for site hosting?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/tried-netlify-for-site-hosting/6478</link>
    <description>Has anyone tried [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting their static site or web app front end?

Any positive or negative experiences?

We’re in the process of evaluating it at the moment. I’m very impressed so far.

The paid plans do seem expensive compared to S3’s static website hosting and even good old website hosting companies. However it is a thoroughly modern approach to hosting a site.</description>

<p>I was writing an answer but since this thread is about Netlify I think we’ve already gone too off topic <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If there is interest in discussing blogging platforms we could start a new thread…</p>

<p>Sure, setting up a VPS for Umami costs - time plus around 3 USD per month. As I manage quite a few servers this one doesn’t really make any new problems… You could also host it serverless - works too.</p>

<p>CMS (Wordpress, etc) have many issues and don’t really work for everyone.

</aside>
<p>Totally with you on this. Most CMS aren’t too big for the purpose. The only one I’m still using (besides static hosting) is <a href="https://silverstripe.org">SilverStripe</a>. But that’s also due to professional stuff.</p>

</aside>
<p>I found Jekyll not right for me. Eleventy is more my thing - running two sites on it atm. My <a href="https://peterthaleikis.com">blog</a> and a <a href="https://browserextension.dev">browser extension development blog</a>. I don’t use Netlify CMS as I find it a waste of time - I’m faster with sublime and git directly. But I’ve integrated it for others to enable them using static publishing - took less than 30 minutes in most cases.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, no effort platforms are a great idea. The no-stress publishing solution here could be <a href="https://hashnode.com/@spekulatius/joinme">Hashnode blogs</a>. You can just publish and add your own domain to the blog. You can also have your own newsletter and subscribers. Plus all your posts are also published on hashnode and you get comments, followers etc. from there. Works pretty well and I see them popping up more and more.</p>

<p>I’m working on my own blogging platform which will have its own server side analytics so I can wait a couple of months until that’s working.</p>

            <p>Netlify is great for static hosting.</p>
<p>I actually did <a href="https://www.pierbover.com/posts/static-hosting-benchmark-2020/">a static hosting benchmark</a> a couple of months ago. My static blog is actually hosted on Netlify.</p>
<p>There are other options to consider in this space though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vercel offers much more bandwidth per month (1TB vs 100GB in Netlify)</li>
<li>Firebase</li>
</ul>
<p>Something I found really lacking with Netlfy was their analytics. You pay $9 per month and you get super limited information. Not worth it IMO.</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/lucaskardo">@lucaskardo</a></p>
<p>interesting idea - Netlify has a lot of fans for it’s simplicity. If you can hook into this and deliver the cost savings at the same time you got an interesting project.</p>
<p>Some small feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I would make the site more ‘light’. The dark theme isn’t for everyone. I would also either stick to the dog or cat (cat is more cute IMHO <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/upside_down_face.png?v=9" title=":upside_down_face:" class="emoji" alt=":upside_down_face:"> ).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, I would keep the naming consistent to make orientation easier:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/bootstrapped/original/2X/0/008cbd40fb2c60f03adb16a516a942aa7a12decf.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/4Rx0VXV5edH4qWmCCmC8Gj1O0v.png?dl=1" title="image"><img src="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/bootstrapped/optimized/2X/0/008cbd40fb2c60f03adb16a516a942aa7a12decf_2_690x233.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="4Rx0VXV5edH4qWmCCmC8Gj1O0v" width="690" height="233" srcset="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/bootstrapped/optimized/2X/0/008cbd40fb2c60f03adb16a516a942aa7a12decf_2_690x233.png, https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/bootstrapped/optimized/2X/0/008cbd40fb2c60f03adb16a516a942aa7a12decf_2_1035x349.png 1.5x, https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/bootstrapped/optimized/2X/0/008cbd40fb2c60f03adb16a516a942aa7a12decf_2_1380x466.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/bootstrapped/optimized/2X/0/008cbd40fb2c60f03adb16a516a942aa7a12decf_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">image</span><span class="informations">2262×767 139 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>(Btw: - (dash) instead of _ (underscore) work better for repo names)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would show example on how to do stuff like on the <a href="https://TailwindCSS.com">TailwindCSS.com</a> or <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/">mailgun</a> homepage. After all, your tools are for developers and should reflect this in the website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Great work, just some thoughts to make it even better <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

            <p>It makes more sense to have Netlify features on top of a main cloud provider like AWS.</p>
<p>Netlify features are great but it can really expensive as you move up the tiers</p>
<p>AWS is a lot cheaper but it takes more time and requires technical skills to deploy websites.</p>
<p>So i decided to build an open source netlify that works on top of your own AWS account.   It requieres zero configuration and takes less than 2 minutes to install and deploy a full production website with 99.99% SLA free (costs $1500/month in Netlify) and HTTPS/SSL.</p>
<p>You can check out the tool  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/point_right.png?v=9" title=":point_right:" class="emoji" alt=":point_right:"> arjan.tools/deploy.html</p>
<p>I hope it saves you time and money just like it did for me.</p>

            <p>Yeah, you are right about the vendor lock-ins. I’m more worried about the effort involved in case I need to migrate away. For static sites I’ve got two alternatives pretty much ready to go in case. Just my nature as a developer.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I agree. But I don’t think using Netlify is a big risk regarding this, considering there isn’t any vendor lock-in. It would be really easy to move from Netlify to something else.</p>

            <p>I’m with you on this: Having only one solution is bad in the long run. Monopolies naturally don’t make innovation and the required investments likely - quite the opposite really. I’m usually building my solutions around the idea that I decouple everything as much as possible so I can swap out ‘parts’ easily. I haven’t used Zeit, but it looks interesting.</p>

            <p>Because I’m a big fan of having alternatives, I have used Zeit (<a href="https://zeit.co/">https://zeit.co/</a>) as well and am happy with their service. We have also tested Netlify for some dnsimple services, and other team members have attested to Netlify’s solid functionality.</p>

            <p>A little late to the party maybe, but I can see everyone celebrated Netlify already.</p>
<p>I can strongly recommend the service. I’m actually hosting a number of sites for myself and others there - pretty much any project which doesn’t have much dynamic content/functionality. Haven’t went down the whole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlify#Jamstack">JAMstack</a> with these - it seems easier to keep it all in one place at the moment. The free plan covers most needs out the box.</p>

            <p>I’m using Netlify (the free one) for my personal blog, built using Hugo. I used to manually setup S3 and LetsEncrypt before, but this is way easier.</p>

            <p>Love netlify as well as <em>Publii</em> which is a desktop CMS for writing your blog posts and it  builds your static blog through the app and syncs it to netlify, gitlab, github, wherever. Very convenient.</p>

            <p>I host my marketing site together with docs and a changelog on Netlify. It was a smooth ride all along except a weird incident yesterday where connections would randomly timeout. It remains a mystery to me why that was happening.</p>
<p>I learned yesterday that If you are going to use Netlify with external DNS providers, it is better to stick with ALIAS/ANAME records or CNAME flattening when pointing to your root domain (instead of A/AAAA records pointing to the root).</p>
