    <title>Hi I&#39;m Andrew Gertig from Mutual and HumansWithKids.com</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-andrew-gertig-from-mutual-and-humanswithkids-com/246</link>
    <description>My name is Andrew and I&#39;m building [Mutual](http://twitter.com/mutualapp) and [HumansWithKids](http://humanswithkids.com).

Mutual is an iOS app I am building with RubyMotion that helps you to better manage who you follow on Twitter.

HumansWithKids is a site focused on parenting that we hope to grow and expand by offering compelling content and resources.

I look forward to meeting and talking with you!</description>
