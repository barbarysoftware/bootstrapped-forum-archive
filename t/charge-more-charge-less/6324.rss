    <title>Charge more! Charge less!</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/charge-more-charge-less/6324</link>
    <description>Patrick McKenize (@patio11) has made &quot;Charge more&quot; into his catch cry. 

Of course, &quot;charge more&quot; can&#39;t be applied to all people at all times - just 99% of all first-time bootstrappers! Software developers, in particular, need encouragement to price according to the value their product has to their customer - and to understand that this has nothing to do with the effort to create the product.

Justin Jackson (@mijustin) recently wrote a more nuanced [blog post on the topic, arguing that perhaps some of us need to charge less](https://justinjackson.ca/charge-more):

&gt; **Maybe you should charge less**
&gt;
&gt; We should pay attention to this idea of charging less for the value you provide. It&#39;s the flipside of &quot;charge more,&quot; and it has its own advantages.
&gt; 
&gt; By keeping prices low, you make renewing a no-brainer. You make switching &#39;not worth the effort.&#39; You&#39;ll lower ARPU, but you&#39;ll get higher long-term retention.

Perhaps this is a dangerous blog post because some first-timers will use it as justification to give into their fears of charging decent prices.

What&#39;s been your experience with charging less vs charging more?</description>

<p>Maybe it is exactly due to years of crying out the Patrick’s war cry? Because I distinctly remember that was not the case some 10 years ago. (My memory is not perfect, of course.)</p>

<p>But it is. The rest have a negligible effect on the new founded business.</p>
<p>The new founder does see that the competitor charges $100/mo, and yet decides to go for $10/mo. Patrick’s Edict™ fixes that most glaring overlook of consequences.</p>
<p><em>Now</em> the noob can start considering “landscape, demand” and whatnot.</p>

<p>Patrick specifically talked to noobs at business, whose shared trait was to try and charge ridiculously low prices (the famous $5/mo).</p>
<p>If anyone uncritically applies that advise to businesses in later life cycles, it is not Patrick’s fault.</p>

<p>What’s odd to me, is we keep having the “charge more” discussion as if the founder’s psychology is the only variable. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>
<p>There are so many other variables that matter more:</p>
<ul>
<li>the competitive landscape</li>
<li>customer demand</li>
<li>how hard it is to reach, and convert, customers</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not super worried about first-timers. From what I’ve seen in <a href="https://megamaker.co">MegaMaker</a>, most first-time founders are starting with a <a href="https://blog.prisync.com/competitive-pricing-advantages-vs-disadvantages/">competitive pricing</a> strategy. That’s not a bad place to start. It’s a good foundation for adding other techniques, like  <a href="https://www.priceintelligently.com/value-based-pricing">value-based</a> pricing.</p>
