    <title>Niche idea and Google long-tail keywords</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/niche-idea-and-google-long-tail-keywords/2747</link>
    <description>One of my research tasks for the validation of the idea was to use Long Tail Pro, a keywords research tool which shows long tail keywords for a central keyword phrase.

I can get roughly 6000-8000 (i know its a big range) of quality traffic (global monthly searches) through from potential customers from quite a targeted set of keywords. My question is, does anyone have any experience in saying that that may be a big enough pool to convert a percentage of them into paying customers? Have you launched a business which is in a smaller niche? 

Anyone with some validation for me?</description>

            <p>Sure. I guess I was trying to figure out whether a particular niche was worth exploring. For instance I work a lot with the new Office 365 platform and there are a lot of specific products that can be built around it and could be explored.</p>
<p>Lets take a helpdesk for arguments sake. If Office 365 helpdesk was hitting 1300 global visits a month, and we could charge $199/month for it lets say, would it be worth investigating. This is just an example…</p>
<p>At what point is it worth exploring?</p>

<p>It is very hard to know without actually trying it. But I think it is pretty tough to get a return from Adwords now, unless at least 2 of the following apply (preferably all 3):<br>
a) You really know what you are doing with Adwords<br>
b) Your product has a lifetime value of $100+<br>
c) There is not much competition in your market</p>
<p>Certainly I am finding it hard to get any reasonable amount of targeted traffic for <a href="http://www.hyperplan.com">http://www.hyperplan.com</a> via Adwords at a bid price I can afford. Even with a long tail campaign. And I like to feel I know what I am doing!</p>

            <p>Yes. Of course, the rule <span class="hashtag">#1</span> in this business is that things can be totally different for your product /  customers. Industry “standard” download to sale ratio is around 1-3%.</p>

            <p>Thank you Zka</p>
<p>So are you saying that 7-12% of the 30% will become paying customers?</p>

            <p>My data are probably relevant to you.</p>
<p><strong>Product:</strong> $20-$30 image processing niche Windows application. Almost 2 years old now.<br>
<strong>Competitors:</strong> Two very similar $30 products and several free solutions like gimp and photoshop plugins. These are usually harder to use, therefore non-tech savvy users pay me instead.<br>
<strong>Total website traffic:</strong> about 2500 unique IP addresses per month, 50-60% coming from google, 70-80% total from search engines.<br>
<strong>Average visit to download ratio:</strong> 30%<br>
<strong>Monthly download to sale ratio:</strong> between 7% and 12% - apparently seasonal</p>
<p>Google webmaster data for the last 30 days:<br>
<strong>Total search impressions:</strong> 9800<br>
<strong>Total clickthrough:</strong> 1200<br>
<strong>Top 5 keywords</strong> add up to less than 800 impressions and 100 clickthroughs. 70 of these are the product name itself.<br>
<strong>Total number of different search keywords:</strong> 350</p>
<p>My top 5 keywords have between 200 and 3000 monthly searches globally according to the google keyword tool. Pretty much all others are below the bar and cannot be measured.</p>
<p>The best part is that these niche long tail keywords have extremely low competition, therefore getting to the top 3 search result spots is very easy. Validation hint: if you see paid google ads appear for a keyword, there is probably profitable demand there. The more ads the more profit to be seen, plan your SEO accordingly.</p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>
