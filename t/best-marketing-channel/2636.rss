    <title>Best marketing channel</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/best-marketing-channel/2636</link>
    <description>What&#39;s your best marketing channel?  I&#39;m looking for some inspiration. 

I&#39;ll start. Direct sales seems to have been the bear for me. So like emailing warm and semi-warm contacts and getting on phone calls with them. 

But I don&#39;t really enjoy this much (as compared to development). 

I&#39;m pretty active on twitter but I consider that more relation ship building. Haven&#39;t seen a lot of direct results from twitter. 

Also sponsored a conference with a but of swag and that seems to have worked fairly well too. Surprisingly.</description>

            <p>I have considered freemium but have not done it for a few reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it would cost me too much in support for clients who are paying nothing</li>
<li>My entry level price of $19 is very cheap for someone that is running a business off the software.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t think I have ever had someone ask for a free version of the software, they are used to traditional desktop vendors charging thousands of $ and anything reasonably priced is welcome.</p>

            <p>Hi Craig,</p>
<p>Have you tried the freemium model before selling via trial? I am currently doing freemium and wondering about the other model <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>No I haven’t read it but heard about it.  Heard a few interviews that Gabriel Weinberg gave - really interesting.  I’m not too much of a reader unfortunately.</p>
<p>Interesting to hear about your experiences - thx for the feedback!</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/kalenjordan">@kalenjordan</a>. Have you read Traction? It’s a useful collection of various channels and a framework for selecting one or more channels. Has a 5-step process: brainstorm, rank, prioritise, test, focus on what works. Of course, one point is that you do exactly what you’re doing now, which is see what’s worked for others <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Traction-Startup-Guide-Getting-Customers-ebook/dp/B00N06Y2DW/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.amazon.com/Traction-Startup-Guide-Getting-Customers-ebook/dp/B00N06Y2DW/</a></p>
<p>I got pretty good at Adwords back in the day, which helped. I haven’t used it in anger lately so rather listen to <a class="mention" href="/u/craigvn">@craigvn</a>!</p>
<p>I also mailed a few bloggers which got my traffic kickstarted. And tried, in my limited ability, to refine my SEO somewhat. I was never an enthusiastic writer though. One thing that brought me content was getting customers who were asking for discounts to do write-ups of how they used the app, and add a few screenshots of their setup. I specifically said not to sugar-coat it and just write what their process was. I’d add the pages to the site and would have various natural-language (rather than salesey) pages, including foreign languages.</p>

            <p>I have found PPC is working pretty well. In my industry the search terms are pretty well defined so I am not sure if that is good or not. To make PPC valuable you need some cash reserves though, it costs me &gt; $1000 p/m and I will soon probably spend twice that.</p>

            <p>Right of course. Amongst a variety of other factors. I’m just interested in hearing a bit from people in this community.</p>
<p>I’m an ecommerce email marketing plugin basically. It’s not something that I think a lot of people are searching for so ppc might be tough.</p>
<p>That’s awesome that you have paid acquisition cracked!  I may just dm you to find out a bit more about that!  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>It depends on your market. What is your market?</p>
<p>I get a lot of sales from just online ads. It can cost a lot of money, $1000-2000 per month but the sales it generates make it worthwhile.</p>
<p>I tried cold calling and even hired a sales person but the ROI was very poor.</p>
