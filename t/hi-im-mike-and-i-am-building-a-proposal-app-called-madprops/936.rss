    <title>Hi I&#39;m Mike and I am building a proposal app called MadProps</title>

    <description>Hey everyone -

My name is Mike Hughes, I know some of you from twitter (@cityzenllc) and some of you from the ExpressionEngine community. I&#39;m currently working on a SaaS called MadProps which is an online proposal and document building app. 

I&#39;ve just started letting very early beta testers in today and looking to get this thing live as soon as possible.

Looking forward to good conversations about bootstrapping, pricing, testing, etc.</description>
