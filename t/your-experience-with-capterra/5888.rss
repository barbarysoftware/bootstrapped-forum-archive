    <title>Your experience with Capterra</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/your-experience-with-capterra/5888</link>
    <description>_(Our last discussion on Capterra was from some years ago, and things change quickly on the Internet.)_

Do you use Capterra, particularly for your B2B SaaS? If so:

* could you briefly tell us why you use Capterra?
* how do you get people to post reviews on Capterra?
* what tips do you have?</description>

            <p>Just to add a current bit of information: at this time, unless you pay for CPC, there is no way for users to get from your Capterra page to your website. The links/buttons simply do not appear.</p>
<p>I would say this makes the whole relationship (sending reviewers their way, displaying their badges, etc) much more questionable.</p>

            <p>We have seen two clients with niche SaaS products with an entry prices in the $500-2K/month range do well with Capterra (generate leads that lead to deals). If you have a niche SaaS offering it’s always worth checking Capterra to see who they feature as your competition.</p>

            <p>Well, I’m gathering reviews too, I just have my doubts as to whether anybody actually uses Capterra to search for software. They offer pay per click placement/advertising and I just can’t see how it could possibly generate converting traffic.</p>

            <p>I also used their $20 gift card campaign and it allowed us to collect over 100 reviews. If someone searches for our product name Capterra’s link comes on the first page and it looks good, if reviews are positive of course.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/bootstrapped/original/2X/d/d216fb4412f3f4a2a4411fe6ed9522a012501129.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/tYxvoMuSUTYGp9s8VrhY7KI3y89.png?dl=1" title="scr.png"><img src="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/bootstrapped/original/2X/d/d216fb4412f3f4a2a4411fe6ed9522a012501129.png" alt="scr" data-base62-sha1="tYxvoMuSUTYGp9s8VrhY7KI3y89" width="690" height="176" data-small-upload="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/bootstrapped/optimized/2X/d/d216fb4412f3f4a2a4411fe6ed9522a012501129_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta">

<p>Also if we were to try Capterra’s pay per click campaign having a number of favorable reviews also helps.</p>

            <p>I am resurrecting an old thread, because I am very interested in recent experiences. I always had my doubts as to advertising on Capterra (I couldn’t believe that so many people would learn about my SaaS from Capterra), but I decided to at least post a product page and get some reviews. Ran a promo-incetivized ($20 gift card) review campaign, got a few reviews, but I don’t see much point: if you are in the same category as QuickBooks Enterprise (nearly 14k reviews) or Oracle Netsuite, it’s difficult to get anywhere near the top of the list.</p>
<p>I see contradictory replies here: most people say that Capterra did nothing for them, while some say it worked great.</p>

            <p>Yes, they are very persistent about repeating the Amazon gift card campaign and can’t understand that we don’t want to spam our users with it.</p>

            <p>Traffic is minimal. Got one good review. Negative: Capterra employees keep spamming me (email, phone) to make an appointment to “discuss future strategy”. I guess they want me to buy the premium membership.</p>
<p>If you’ve got some time add your software there. It can’t hurt. But don’t expect anything big from it.</p>

            <p>At MicroConf Growth 2018, there was a talk by Justin Mares of FOMO (Shopify App) that specifically said “we used Capterra as a leads channel with great success”.  Their MRR is over 100K, so do with that info what you will.  Like any channel, if you have the right message, the right LTV and the right customer, you can do great things.  But if there’s a mismatch, it won’t work.  As usual, “it depends”.  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Capterra can work well for products with higher price points. Enterprise clients particularly will look to Capterra as a source of authority.</p>
<p>It can also work well if you take advantage of their review system. Though I don’t necessarily recommend it, I’ve seen companies game their reviews (one company had hundreds of reviews over a one-week period; I think they offered some kind of incentive at an industry conference). Asking for reviews is totally legit though, especially after a positive customer interaction. Those reviews help your listing to rise to the top and give it a lot of credibility.</p>
<p>If you are selling B2B, have a high CLTV, and can get your customers to leave reviews, then Capterra may be a good choice.</p>

            <p>They offered us $20 Amazon Gift cards for the first 20 reviewers and then gave the app “App of the year” badges in four(!) different nominations. Not sure what’s the benefit for them but we got some nice “social proof” content for the landing page.</p>

            <p>It depends exactly what you want. I am not really interested in seeing a bump of a a hundred random people in my Google Analytics, I would rather 5 people who are real potential buyers. The people who did come from Capterra were highly targeted, they were actually searching for software. But it probably depends on your niche, I expect the more techy the product the less leads you will get.</p>

            <p>Some traffic. No leads. Totally irrelevant.</p>

            <p>We initially listed on Capterra as it seemed to rank very highly in google (position 1 or 2 always) for the key google search terms for our product. When your own product is on page 10 it seemed like a good way to get a bit noticed.</p>
<p>To get people to post reviews we basically just asked them, contacting our known good users. This is something we probably need to do more of. I know a lot of companies offer incentives (Amazon vouchers) to get people to post reviews and Capterra now ask if you do this.</p>
<p>Capterra do have a PPC offering as well and we used it around 4 years ago for a while and got great return on investment. However is it got more popular and the PPC prices went up we stopped doing it. I guess you just need to see how much it is for your category.</p>
<p>I would say of all the product review sites Capterra has easily driven the most traffic for us, it’s the only one we really bother maintaining.</p>

            <p><em>(Our last discussion on Capterra was from some years ago, and things change quickly on the Internet.)</em></p>

<ul>
<li>could you briefly tell us why you use Capterra?</li>
