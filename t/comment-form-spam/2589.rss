    <title>Comment form spam</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/comment-form-spam/2589</link>
    <description>I must be getting famous, as I&#39;m seeing a lot of comment form spam. As in, someone fills out a form on my website, usually saying &quot;We could improve your blog blah blah blah.&quot;

And it seems the person making the claim isnt some spammer in a third world country. They are genuine web designers/SEO/whatever in places like the US,  at least looking from their websites.

Again, this isn&#39;t an automated bot, but an actual human being filling out a form.

It makes me wonder: Is someone teaching this to people? As in telling them they need to be pro-active, search for clients etc?

Does anyone else see this?</description>

            <p>Yes, they are generic, copy pasted comments that have nothing to do with your website.</p>

            <p>I get some of those as well, however usually they are generic in nature. You can usually tell if they haven’t actually read anything on your site.</p>
<p>I don’t get many real personal ones.</p>
