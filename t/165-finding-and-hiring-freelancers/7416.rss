            <p>Thanks for the episode <a class="mention" href="/u/stevemcleod">@SteveMcLeod</a>, it was excellent as always. As a developer/consultant that works and have worked with a few bootstrapped companies, Iâ€™m very interested in understanding the challenges that founders face with hiring and working with freelancers.</p>
<p>One tip I have is asking other developers to refer someone to you. When I recommend someone, and I know the founder well, I always go the extra mile in trying make sure they are a good fit.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/stevemcleod">@SteveMcLeod</a> Thanks for the episode.  The process you describe seems quite good.</p>
<p>What I like about hiring (remote) freelancers on a part time basis is that it opens up job opportunities for e.g. stay at home parents to work for a few hours a day.</p>
<p>I must say that my experience with upwork is mixed, but positive on balance. I also found a great freelancer on linkedin, when they had their <span class="hashtag">#lookingforwork</span> badge visible.</p>
