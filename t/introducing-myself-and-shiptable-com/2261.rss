    <title>Introducing myself - and ShipTable.com</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/introducing-myself-and-shiptable-com/2261</link>
    <description>Hi!

I&#39;m Will, and I&#39;m really enjoying reading about this group so far. You guys are doing really interesting stuff, and I look forward to participating.

My project is http://www.shiptable.com - an order management backend for Apple Pay. I think Apple Pay is an amazing monetezation path for apps, but it seems that you need a web-based service to

 1. Actually capture payment
 2. Handle customer communication (confirmation emails, tracking, etc)
 3. Communicate with shipping channels as necessary

The mechanics of those tasks aren&#39;t core to most businesses, which makes them unnecessary distractions that be handled by an outside service for a small fee. I&#39;d love feedback on this project - it&#39;s been a few years since I was involved in iOS development!

Regards,
Will</description>

            <p>Welcome Will – payment and advertising integrations for mobile apps seem to be going gonzo.  I wish I knew more about them.</p>
