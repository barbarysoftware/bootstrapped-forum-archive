    <title>Job site for stay at home parents?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/job-site-for-stay-at-home-parents/7268</link>
    <description>Something Steve mentioned on the last podcast episode was hiring stay at home parents, in this instance for a support role I have. The idea being to get someone probably a bit over qualified who values the flexibility a business like mine can give them over getting more money for a full time roll elsewhere.

Has anyone seen job sites catering to that demographic, I can&#39;t find any with a bit of googling, maybe someone has actually used one :)</description>

            <p>Hi Robin, I hired a similar type of role on Upwork a while ago. Getting an English-native speaker might be a little expensive though. But I guess for a support role that won’t even be necessary (the woman I hired is French but her English is decent enough).</p>
