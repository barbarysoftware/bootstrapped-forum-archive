    <description>Just released today&#39;s episode of Zero to Scale. It&#39;s an interview we did with Bryan Harris where we discuss some great points about finding first customers, building an email list, and ultimately how he launched a product and received over $200k+ in a matter of days.

            <p>Hey Matt - appreciate you bringing this to my attention. Sounds like we definitely need to clean up the mobile responsiveness! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>Hi Justin, a couple of notes on the design of the site:</p>
<ul>
<li>I browse with JS disabled by default, and there’s no visible way to download the episode.</li>
<li>When viewing the site on my phone, I got about twelve words into the text when the content was completely obscured by a “sign up to our list!” box, “Powered by Drip”.  Absolutely <em>terrible</em> UX; if I hadn’t visited the episode page from here, so I knew what I was getting in for, that would have been the end of my visit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
