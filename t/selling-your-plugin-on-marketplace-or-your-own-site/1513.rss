            <p>What <a class="mention" href="/u/daverodenbaugh">@daverodenbaugh</a> said! : )</p>
<p>The <a href="http://WP.org" rel="nofollow noopener">WP.org</a> repo is a great way to test an idea. Put a basic plugin together that solves a part of a problem area and see how it does. Then add a survey to the sidebar asking if people would be willing to buy a Pro version with features x, y, z and collect emails. This is exactly what I did for WP Migrate DB. I gave a talk about a year ago on all the steps I took: <a href="https://deliciousbrains.com/bostonwp-meetup-presentation-video/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://deliciousbrains.com/bostonwp-meetup-presentation-video/</a>. There’s some other tips in there on how I built my launch list.</p>
<p>We use WooCommerce to power our site, but I’d choose Easy Digital Downloads if I was starting from scratch today.</p>

            <p>Produce a free version (lite) and put in <a href="http://WP.org" rel="nofollow noopener">WP.org</a>.  That’s going to be your <span class="hashtag">#1</span> marketplace over all others, honestly.  Use that lite version to get folks to upgrade to Pro.</p>

            <p>I feel like is compare between “cut of every deal” vs “effort bring the customer to buy on your site” ?<br>
and is a bit extreme hard when you are just nobody.</p>
<p>perhaps selling a lite version on the market place and a pro version on my own site will help ?</p>

            <p>Just to throw in my 2 cents, I have purchased many things from code canyon and will not do that again.</p>
<ul>
<li>Low quality</li>
<li>Some were broken</li>
</ul>
<p>So now when I see stuff on Code Canyon I just think low quality code.  Probably cause the better developers know they can charge more.</p>
<p>I prefer finding stuff through google, blogs, or on the developer’s site (like Redactor) because it tends to contain much higher quality content and am willing to pay the price.</p>

            <p>Like <a class="mention" href="/u/bradt">@bradt</a>, I too sell WP plugins (<a href="http://awpcp.com" rel="nofollow noopener">AWPCP</a> and <a href="http://businessdirectoryplugin.com" rel="nofollow noopener">BusinessDirectory</a>).  I don’t like CodeCanyon’s model for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crowded space.  If I list something in there, chances are competitors can too.  When you have too many choices, it’s harder for a customer to pick</li>
<li>CC gets their cut of every deal, less profit to you</li>
<li>They set the prices to a certain level (IIRC–maybe this has changed) making it hard to sell things like single/multi site licenses (I think you can do “user” and “developer” now)</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d rather have full control over the sales process and drive customers from the repository to my site.  It’s been a much better experience IMO.</p>

            <p>This is just from my limited perspective, but I’m a WP developer, and I never buy plugins from marketplaces like Code Canyon. All the good ones I use are sold directly by the developers, or through a larger plugin’s marketplace (e.g. extensions for WooCommerce, etc. sold by Woo).</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/bradt">@bradt</a> might have some insight into this.</p>
