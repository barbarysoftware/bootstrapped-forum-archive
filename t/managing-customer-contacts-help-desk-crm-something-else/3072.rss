    <title>Managing customer contacts: help desk, CRM, something else?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/managing-customer-contacts-help-desk-crm-something-else/3072</link>
    <description>My business is expanding, and there are getting to be a lot more pre-sales and support questions than I can handle by myself ina day. 

I&#39;ve got enough sales to support hiring someone part time at least to help  out with these e-mails and phone calls.

I don&#39;t want to lose any of the conversations over time, though. For example, if a customer asks for something special before their order, I want to make sure that I know about that when they follow up after the order. Or if they are asking for a repeat or clarification of something asked a while back, I&#39;d like to be able to see the original conversation.

I also think this is helpful for training purposes, so I can see how my new employee is responding to the customers.

Finally, I want to be able to assign incoming e-mail requests to a particular person, so that they can handle the customer for that request stream.

Is there a tool that&#39;s oriented around doing this kind of thing? I&#39;ve tried a few different CRM and help desk offerings (and there are a LOT of them on the market) and none seemed quite right.</description>

            <p>With SupportBee you can originate a ticket from the help desk, just like sending the customer an email. I’ve just tested this with the free plan.<br>
(we’re also looking for a help desk solution, but prefer self hosted, like HelpSpot. )</p>

            <p>Freshdesk seems to be missing the following features which would be really useful to have:</p>
<ol>
<li>The ability to easily set a followup reminder after a certain number of days.</li>
<li>The ability to ORIGINATE a ticket from within the helpdesk by sending the customer an e-mail</li>
</ol>
<p>Which help desks have these features?</p>

            <p>We’re using <a href="http://www.helpscout.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">HelpScout</a> for managing support. It’s pretty barebones compared to other solutions, but the functionality they have is great for teams our size (3 people).</p>

            <p>Someone posted previously about using Trello for working through the sales process with prospects. After looking at a lot of CRMs etc. I realized it had the least friction. Haven’t jumped into that stage yet, but hopefully soon!</p>

            <p>I’m now using Freshdesk alongside regular e-mail.</p>
<p>No major problems yet.</p>
<p>I do wish it was easier to see a customer’s support history when replying.</p>
<p>Also, the ability to set a reminder to follow up in a couple days if the customer has not responsed would be great. This is a very CRM kind of thing. Freshdesk was promising this a couple years ago, but haven’t gotten around to implementing it. See this page: <a href="https://support.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/topics/7284" rel="nofollow noopener">https://support.freshdesk.com/support/discussions/topics/7284</a></p>

            <p>How’s this for insanity:<br>
<a href="http://www.capterra.com/help-desk-software/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.capterra.com/help-desk-software/</a></p>
<p>A list of  209 different help desk options!!!</p>
<p>This really goes to show that you shouldn’t worry about re-creating something that already exists. There’s a ton of niches this could apply to which would help you get a handle on things. This applies to CRM, too. When looking at the CRM side, I found a “CRM for tour guides”.</p>
<p>Freshdesk seems to do a little more than SupportBee. It has a bigger following, which makes me feel more comfortable that it’ll be supported. It’s my leading choice for the moment, unless I find a showstopper.</p>

            <p>Sounds like the consensus here is to get away from CRM apps and look at the helpdesk focussed stuff.</p>
<p>I guess I started looking into CRM because the conversation views seemed so nice. I’ll dig deeper into the helpdesk world and see what I can find.</p>

            <p>As <a class="mention" href="/u/ian">@ian</a> said, don’t use a CRM for customer support as these functions have two completely different workflows and deliverables. Past a certain scale (say dozens of different customers including people/departments in large corporations), it’s nice to have both types of software and integrate them (i.e. you see support tickets in CRM accounts/contacts). I used <a href="http://Salesforce.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Salesforce.com</a> in combination with <a href="http://Desk.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Desk.com</a> in the past and likes that combo <em>after</em> I had spent a significant amount of time customizing each of them to our needs.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I’d recommend Desk for a company that’s not using SFDC as a few things such as handling inbound spam email took me a fair amount of time to figure out in the <a href="http://Desk.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Desk.com</a> admin. On the other hand it’s basically free if you have just one user.</p>

            <p>You should never use a CRM for support tickets. Period.</p>
<p>Also, anyone on this board probably shouldn’t use a CRM for sales/pre-sales. Just do it all through your help desk app. We’re just getting big enough we’re I’m considering using a sales/crm tool for sales stuff, very few companies on this board are HelpSpot size (also you should check out <a href="http://www.helpspot.com">HelpSpot</a> ;)).</p>
<p>If you don’t have a ‘sales person’ CRM will be a waste of time. Funnel it all through support as most small/medium bootstrapped businesses there tends to be little distinction. The same person helping a customer do an install is also giving out pricing details, etc. They only need one tool and that’s a ticketing tool. They’re not going to be pro-actively emailing customers on their birthday, visiting them on-site, manually cold emailing people, etc.</p>

            <p>I spent a long time looking 2 years ago at CRM’s and … struggled.</p>
<p>Nearly all my interactions via customers is via an email ticketing system / helpdesk (happens to be Helpspot).</p>
<p><strong>ALL</strong> the CRM’s I saw did email tickets poorly (just one e.g. poor at concept of having a ticket assigned to only 1 person at a time) so then you had to use both. But they don’t integrate (apart from in most superficial way).</p>
<p>Also most / all CRM’s deal with individuals whereas most of the info I need is at the company level (e.g. I don’t care if its bob or sarah from acme asking for help - needs to pick up same records).</p>
<p>I knocked my own franken system together using some gaffer tape and javascript - has an iFrame toolbar in front of helpdesk system - javascript polling for email address in ticket - searches in custom DB for basic customer details to put in toolbar with links to main systems. Don’t have anything in place for things like ‘sales pipeline’ (as don’t have a process for inside sales that needs it) etc but could add it.</p>

            <p>Yep, Freshdesk might work for you. We use it for Tech Support.</p>
<p>Free for 2 or 3 users.</p>
<p>Incoming emails can be assigned to someone. It’ll create a record for them as well. And you can add more info (phone number, etc.)</p>
<p>I’m not sure if NEW emails from that same customer would get assigned to the same rep automatically (although it does have some scripting capability)</p>
<p>Support is surprisingly good in the free level.</p>

            <p>Some of the packages I’ve looked at so far:</p>
<p>Odoo, SugarCRM, Insightly, <a href="http://Intercom.io" rel="nofollow noopener">Intercom.io</a>, Zoho, Streak, Capsule CRM, Nutshell, SupportBee.</p>
<p>Odoo: hard to configure, never got it working.<br>
Capsule CRM: Couldn’t get this to work.<br>
Zoho: Couldn’t get this to work right despite multiple phone calls with support.<br>
SugarCRM: seems to be targeting a way different market.<br>
Insightly: doesn’t automatically save incoming/outgoing e-mails.<br>
<a href="http://Intercom.io" rel="nofollow noopener">Intercom.io</a>: weird interface, doesn’t seem to support searching.<br>
Streak: simple to use, but again requires you to manually add e-mails to its system.<br>
Nutshell: Didn’t support attachments in e-mails.<br>
SupportBee: favorite so far, but I’ve just signed up for the free trial.</p>

            <p>Interesting.  Maybe you can list the ones that you tried and what the issues were that you hit with them specifically?</p>
<p>I spent a tiny bit of time looking into this myself but ended up sticking with gmail for now.  I still have a pretty low support volume though and am doing it myself so probably have different needs.</p>

<p>I don’t want to lose any of the conversations over time, though. For example, if a customer asks for something special before their order, I want to make sure that I know about that when they follow up after the order. Or if they are asking for a repeat or clarification of something asked a while back, I’d like to be able to see the original conversation.</p>
<p>I also think this is helpful for training purposes, so I can see how my new employee is responding to the customers.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to be able to assign incoming e-mail requests to a particular person, so that they can handle the customer for that request stream.</p>
<p>Is there a tool that’s oriented around doing this kind of thing? I’ve tried a few different CRM and help desk offerings (and there are a LOT of them on the market) and none seemed quite right.</p>
