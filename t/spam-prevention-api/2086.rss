    <title>Spam-prevention API?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/spam-prevention-api/2086</link>
    <description>Are any of you integrating with a spam-blocker API/service you like?  (e.g., [Akismet][1], [Mollom][2])  

A significant feature of my product accepts form submissions on behalf of my customers.  Because the typical form lifespan is only 2-3 months, spam hasn&#39;t been an issue but I&#39;m sure it will be eventually.  

I hate captcha with the fire of a thousand suns, so I&#39;d like to integrate with a service API that does intelligent analysis of the user input, and blocks at least *most* spammy submissions.  Form fields will vary quite a bit from customer to customer, so it needs to allow for flexible form structure.  

I&#39;m planning to pay for it, since it&#39;s something I don&#39;t have to build and it provides significant value.

            <p>Thanks - their API looks straightforward, and their pricing is super reasonable ($5/mo at my level) Akismet sounds like a perfect place to start.</p>

            <p>Can’t go wrong with Askimet. Although it’s been a few years since I integrated it.</p>
