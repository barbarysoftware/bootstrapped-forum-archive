    <title>92,000 words on building and launching a SaaS business</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/92-000-words-on-building-and-launching-a-saas-business/5375</link>
    <description>A few years back, I wrote Starting &amp; Sustaining to help folks build and launch apps with less pain. About a year ago, I published the first edition on Medium for free for anyone to read, and, not too long after that, I begain writing the second edition in the open for anyone to read as well.

The first edition came in at about 36,000 words. After running Sifter for a few more years after that and ultimately selling it, it turns out I had about 92,000 words on SaaS in this second edition. (And that was me trying to keep it short and sweet.) It&#39;s still in the process of being edited, and I&#39;ll need to record the audio book and put together some of the other convenient reference materials, but it&#39;s at a point where I feel comfortable sending people over to read it.

Just visit the [Starting &amp; Sustaining book site](https://startingandsustaining.com/book/), and scroll down to the &quot;Book Progress&quot; section for a full table of contents. I&#39;m hoping to have the for-purchase packages finished up with Kindle, epub, PDF, and audiobook formats ready to go in December, but until then, all the content is there on the site.

There&#39;s also [the complementary podcast](https://startingandsustaining.com/podcast/) where I interview other founders of various types of software businesses and talk about trials and tribulations. The frequency is slowing down a little bit while I&#39;m focusing on finishing up the book, but I&#39;m still aiming to get out at least one a month if not two.

Of course, if anybody has questions (or finds mistakes) please don&#39;t hesitate to reach out.</description>

<p>I’d love to hear more about how things are going. I saw the post on spam. I wonder if you have anything to add to the new chapter in the book about mitigating fraud and spam based on your recent experience?</p>

<p>I think you’ve done a good job in that chapter of describing credit card fraud. BTW Stripe has improved their fraud protection a lot in the last year or so. Their ever-updating <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/disputes/prevention">docs on preventing fraud are a must-read</a> for anyone using Stripe to charge credit cards.</p>
<p>The chapter you linked doesn’t have much to say about comment spambots. It is probably not so important for most SaaS apps? In any case, from day one, I was logging create date, user agent, and ip address for each bit of user-contributed content. (I recently aded http referrer to that.) I’m glad I was doing that all along - it made it much easier to investigate and solve the comment spam problem.</p>
<p>I recall <a class="mention" href="/u/jitbit">@jitbit</a> mentioning <a href="http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/subdomain-phishing-in-saas-apps/4852">subdomain spamming</a>. Perhaps that’s worth a mention in your book? At small scale, it is easy to check every single newly created account against this - that’s what I’m currently doing.</p>

            <p>Honestly, I just ask around. With the first edition, I had a friend who was an editor and happened to have enough availability. With this second edition, I just asked other folks who self-published. This time around, using GitHub was central to my writing/editing/publishing process, so I wanted to find an editor comfortable with Git. Brad Frost had written and published <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Atomic Design</a> in the open and used Git, so I just asked him who edited it for him.</p>

            <p>I highly recommend Garrett’s book, Starting &amp; Sustaining. Before starting Feature Upvote I read the first edition. I found it extremely helpful in preparing to create and launch a bootstrapped SaaS into a crowded market.</p>
<p>Garrett’s success with Sifter, a bug tracking app, is what convinced me it is possible to have a viable product when there is a dominant incumbent.</p>

            <p>Hi Garrett, I read the first edition and enjoyed it.<br>
What do you do about editing? Where do you find a suitable editor?</p>
