    <title>Hey, I&#39;m Andrew, from Ireland, and co-founder of NeoCoach (fitness managed for you)</title>

    <description>Hi, I’m Andrew, originally from Ireland.

I worked over the past few years in product and ops at a number of startups (primarily in SE Asia). Now, I&#39;ve started NeoCoach, an app that pairs you 1-on-1 with an expert coach. 

Ever think it&#39;s funny that we outsource many things in our life (our haircuts, medical advice, accounting, teaching) but often try to manage our fitness completely on our own? NeoCoach is changing that!

At a very early stage of company building and I hope I can find some helpful tips in this community as well as contribute my fair share. I’m glad to be a part of this community and look forward to meeting you all.

Any and all feedback is always sought after, and more than happy to offer the community access if anyone is interested :slight_smile:</description>
