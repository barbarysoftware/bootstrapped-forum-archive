    <title>Any examples with subject directories using category-specific affiliate/Amazon links?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/any-examples-with-subject-directories-using-category-specific-affiliate-amazon-links/4179</link>
    <description>I am looking for examples of websites that do curated resource directories and then use smart category-specific affiliate links. 

E.g. Recipe websites that link to specific cooking books on **egg techniques** when showing recipes using **eggs**. Or a webpage showing a bunch of tutorial videos on say &quot;drawing human figures&quot; and linking to best Amazon books for the same category. 

Or if something like http://www.dmoz.org/Games/Video_Games/Recreation/Board_Games/ included a book like this https://www.amazon.com/Games-We-Played-Golden-Board/dp/1568983972/ (with affiliate link in a real example). Preferably nicely in a non-offensive ways. 

I have no troubles finding: 
* Affiliate link websites that do things like comparing X products in the same categories with Amazon link to each product (too narrow for my taste - a whole website around small number of products)
* Ads for the same item/service/product on _every_ page of the directory (not curated ads)
* Generic ads that may show some content that may or may not relevant (clearly not curated ads, imperfect matching algorithm or customer tracking messing things up)

But I can&#39;t find something that is doing curation for both content and ads and use that as a high-conversion. 

I feel they **must** exist, but can&#39;t quite find them when starting from the need to demonstrate this approach.</description>
