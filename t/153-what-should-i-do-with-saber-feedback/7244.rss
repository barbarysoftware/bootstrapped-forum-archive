    <title>#153: “What should I do with Saber Feedback?”</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/153-what-should-i-do-with-saber-feedback/7244</link>
    <description>I seek @freyfogle&#39;s advice on some [Saber Feedback](https://saberfeedback.com/) stuff. We talk about pricing, free plans, legacy framework woes, and database hosting.

We also chat about:

* running  [Geomob](https://thegeomob.com/) as an online conference instead as a COVID alternative to an in-person conference
* automating away common customer support enquiries

            <p>Good advice from <a class="mention" href="/u/freyfogle">@freyfogle</a> !<br>
Do only what is really necessary.<br>
Regarding your idea to go to AWS/S3 for storage: If you are afraid your disk goes full with png’s, just buy Linode block storage and attach it to your server.  It’s a bit like a larger disk for your server.  That works well for png’s, but not for the database.<br>
About ember: Ember is for people who like ember.  If you are not into ember, migrate away.  I would consider this as necessary for you.</p>
