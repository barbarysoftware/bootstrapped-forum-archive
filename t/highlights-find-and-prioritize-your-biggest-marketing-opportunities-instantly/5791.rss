    <title>Highlights: Find and prioritize your biggest marketing opportunities, instantly</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/highlights-find-and-prioritize-your-biggest-marketing-opportunities-instantly/5791</link>
    <description>Hey guys! We&#39;re creating Highlights to help busy founders and solopreneurs find and prioritize the biggest marketing opportunities from their analytics and email marketing tools.

It&#39;s _almost_ magic: ;-)

1. You connect your analytics and email marketing tools
2. We analyze performance and trends to identify optimization opportunities

- Are your upsell emails becoming less effective? 
- Can an old blog post drive new revenue? 
- Are email clicks leading to bounces on your website?

3. We prioritize improvements based on volume and the impact on your business&#39; bottom-line
4. You make the changes, we track the performance

Thank you for taking a look!</description>

<p>The general approach is described right on the landing page: <a href="https://blog.growthhackers.com/the-practical-advantage-of-the-ice-score-as-a-test-prioritization-framework-cdd5f0808d64" rel="nofollow noopener">I.C.E.</a>. The service apparently saves you the time you’d have to invest yourself listing all the improvement opportunities and assigning them the ICE rating.</p>

            <p>Good point. Of course we can give a lot more intelligence when/if goals and conversions are properly configured, but there’s actually a lot that can be done with default metrics (bounces, opens, clicks, click paths, etc) and tracking (trends, volume, etc). The algorithm already works quite well, we’re excited to release a first version in a month or so. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Yes, it does make sense. However, I don’t really understand how it works. “Too good to be true”, I agree with <a class="mention" href="/u/danielherken">@danielherken</a></p>
<p>Also, I still, even after 10+ years in business, do not have properly configured goals and conversion tracking. It seems a requirement for your service to have properly configured analytics for web site, emails, purchases etc.</p>

            <p>Hmm You’re right. That’s pretty weird. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> We’re using Unbounce for the landing page. It will definitely be better with our own code base. Does the product make sense to you?</p>
