    <title>80/20 Traction - What&#39;s the single biggest action you took to get your first 100 customers?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/80-20-traction-whats-the-single-biggest-action-you-took-to-get-your-first-100-customers/5695</link>
    <description>I am just at the beginning of my first software project &amp; am having difficulties attracting users.

I&#39;m trying to gauge for stickiness right now. No payment, just onboarding &amp; attracting ppl to try it. I&#39;m open to all thoughts!

Thank you &amp; look forward to reading some advice,

            <p>I recommend installing <a href="http://www.fullstory.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.fullstory.com</a> (they have a decent free plan) and watching what users do in your app and improving it based on that.</p>

            <p>Attracting people to try it is the top problem; the first problem is getting people to your site who might try it if they knew it existed. Original content of the net wins; create good original content that the people who might be interested in you app are definitely interested in, and that will attract them.</p>
