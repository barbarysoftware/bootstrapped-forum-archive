    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Leon. I&#39;ve built NimbleText and TimeSnapper</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-leon-ive-built-nimbletext-and-timesnapper/3201</link>
    <description>Hello. I&#39;m Leon, I&#39;ve been visiting this forum most days for a while now, sometimes responding, and I see that posting an introduction is a normal part of the social order.

I have three products currently: [NimbleText](http://NimbleText.com) and NimbleSET, as well as [TimeSnapper](http://TimeSnapper.com) (which I jointly own). 

I&#39;m currently writing a book about building simple products, to be called [Your First Product](http://YourFirstProduct.com) and for which I am doing far *far* more research than I ever performed when simply building products. I also have a blog at [secretGeek](http://secretGeek.net) where I make silly jokes.

Thanks for being part of an interesting community. It&#39;s always good to see people&#39;s responses here.

kind regards
Leon

I forgot to mention: I have very much more that I need to learn. Just so *so* much.</description>

            <p>Hi Steve.<br>
Yeh, we haven’t built a Mac version yet, but I think we will one day.<br>
I use OS X very rarely, so I’m not in a position to develop seriously for it at the moment. But one day… one day…</p>

            <p>Hi Leon, and welcome.</p>
<p>I took a look at the website for TimeSnapper. My friend and I had an idea for a similar product last year, and we settled on the name, “Russian dashcam”, after the common Russian practice of having a video camera on a car’s dashboard, recording in case of an accident! TimeSnapper is a much better name.</p>
