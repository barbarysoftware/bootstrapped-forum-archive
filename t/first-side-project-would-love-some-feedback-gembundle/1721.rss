    <title>First side project, would love some feedback - GemBundle</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/first-side-project-would-love-some-feedback-gembundle/1721</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m fairly new to the development world and brand new to the side project world. In the long term, I&#39;d like to start my own business, one that has a profit model. For the time being, I&#39;m content building apps that help people, and in no way, shape or form, are going to make me a millionaire.

My first real project, one that is still in it&#39;s very early stages, is [GemBundle][1]. The website was built in order for myself and fellow Ruby programmers to find a new and better way to discover Ruby Gems. There are currently two other solutions out there, but none of them satisfied the goal that I was after, so I decided to build my own.

There are a few things that I know need to happen, in order to become more successful:
1. Add an about section
2. Add an FAQ
3. Revamp the comments section, inside of each gem show page

Thanks for taking a look, and I&#39;m looking forward to your feedback.

Steve

            <p>I agree with DavidW. I spent years building developer side projects, and only recently (2-3 years ago) got serious about trying to sell anything. It’s amazing how different everything is in a side project where you’re trying to make even a little money.</p>
<p>Different people online claim it takes at least 2-5 years to establish a business and get going properly (I’m nowhere near there yet!). So you should probably start pretty soon <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>If you want to gain skills at creating your own business, you should probably try and work on a side project that’s a business.  I say that as someone who, over the years, created a number of moderately successful “for fun” side projects without any real business aim to them.  It’s like anything, I guess: to get better you need to practice what you want to get better at.  The side projects will probably help you improve as a developer, but you might as well try and throw the business stuff in there as well, to maximize your learning.</p>
<p>I hope that’s somewhat coherent… I’m a bit tired today!</p>

            <p>I suppose statistically yes, its not proven - but it does seem that it doesn’t matter much! Thanks, its quite interesting that <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>I think my sample size is too small to be relevant.  &lt; 3000 uniques, with 20ish trials.</p>
<p>Nobody who signed up for a trial actually visited my about page.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/johnf">@johnf</a> - Out of interest, do you have any data that would correlate visiting the about section with signups or purchases? Might be interesting to know if a user who signed up was more likely to hit the about section.</p>

            <p>Why do you think an about section would help it become more successful?</p>
<p>On my last saas the about section was viewed 0.3% of the time.</p>
