    <title>Got a dev buddy sick &amp; tired of bad options for clients?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/got-a-dev-buddy-sick-tired-of-bad-options-for-clients/6482</link>
    <description>👋🏾 Hi folks, I&#39;m Helen an ex-front-end developer, 2x startup founder who&#39;s focused on helping dev shops and agencies with their business development. Would someone introduce me to a friend/colleague who manages a 2-5 person dev shop?  Like to chat about their challenges w/ getting projects and clients that fit their skills, values, and team culture. Looking to help folks out.

Here&#39;s my quick pitch... &lt;still a wip&gt; 👇🏾
Tired of last-minute clients and projects being your only options? Fulfilling projects are what software dev shops, consultancies &amp; agencies need. I&#39;m hustling to build client relations that align with your success. Tag-team w/ my Midwest grit to get shit done. 😉

Connect or Introduce me - https://www.linkedin.com/in/hgriffinjr/
WIP - http://envoydeals.com/

Welcome any and all advice! Thanks y&#39;all!</description>
