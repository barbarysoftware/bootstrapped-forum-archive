    <title>UserVoice (feedback app) type apps built by bootstrappers?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/uservoice-feedback-app-type-apps-built-by-bootstrappers/3364</link>
    <description>Hey,

Any of you here built a UserVoice type app or know of someone who has? I mean UserVoice the original product (idea feedback) not their help desk app. I have an idea that I&#39;d be interested in exploring with someone who has that kinda app. As they&#39;re a help desk competitor I can&#39;t really use them :) plus their product has gotten more complicated than what I&#39;m thinking.</description>

            <p>I looked into uservoice alternatives for a bit. Was surprised not to really find much. Seems like there’s an opportunity there.</p>
