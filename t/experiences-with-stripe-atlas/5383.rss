    <title>Experiences with Stripe Atlas?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/experiences-with-stripe-atlas/5383</link>
    <description>I have been looking to implement Stripe for a couple of projects ([suet.co](https://suet.co/) as one) and recently just got an invite to Stripe Atlas. However, I&#39;m seeing a lot of mixed reviews online especially as regards tax. Does anyone have experience using it? What&#39;s your take?</description>
