    <title>[Google] Analytics review as a service</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/google-analytics-review-as-a-service/3505</link>
    <description>Every time I look in Google Analytics they seem to have changed it and I seem to fall down a rabit hole for an hour or two but still end up with no good info or actionable insights.

Now that every man and his dog is following Dan Norris&#39;s playbook for productised services wondering if there are any recommendations for a service where someone would look (monthly/quarterly) at the Goog and give me a digest report with **insights** and **actionable** info

Oh - should specify that I am not after something that just repeats useless vanity info like &quot;average time on page increased 12% to 1:45 from last month&quot;  - need human touch to decide what info is useful and actionable.</description>

            <p>Dave: Were you selling it alongside other services that were getting attention?</p>
<p>Was it hard to reach people or were people just not interested?</p>

            <p>I’ve been thinking a bit about providing this service, as well.  It seems like a core first step to becoming data driven, thus essential.</p>
<p>However, 90% of analytics setups are broken.</p>
<p>Peep Laja of ConversionXL talked about people who provide this service on eCommerce sites – apparently the demand is quite high, and he said that people are charging something like $25k to set this up for an established eCommerce site.</p>
<p>The following might be a site to check out; Peep mentioned him as a solid guy:<br>

            <p>Don’t know of anything out there, but I imagine it would be a hard service to scale as it such a custom thing.</p>
<p>I’ve been using mix panel custom events to get a better feel for interactions in my app, depending on your traffic volume it’s a nice addition to GA that is more custom to your application.</p>

            <p>My husband’s app might be what you’re looking for: <a href="http://briefmetrics.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://briefmetrics.com</a></p>
<p>Emails you weekly with stats — how many visits, what your top referrals are, what new referrals you got, your bounce rate, your traffic compared to the last week, etc. I hate Google Analytics and it’s been a huge help for me keeping on top of things.</p>

            <p>I bet most small businesses, such as bricks and mortar ones, don’t even realise GA exists and would love a report that says who is visiting, where from (geographically and Web based) and so on…</p>
<p>You could get a bunch of local business URLs, do a GET for each home page, segment to who already has GA and who doesn’t, and then approach each segment differently. Those that <em>do</em> use it may at least provide some insight as to how they use it, which you might be able to apply to the others.</p>

            <p>We offered this as a service years ago, as I more or less live in Analytics. Signups: 0.</p>
