    <title>Finally saying &#39;hi&#39; :)</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/finally-saying-hi/6783</link>
    <description>Hello everyone :slight_smile: 

I&#39;m Peter, a developer and entrepreneur. While I&#39;m originally from Germany I&#39;ve been traveling for the last six years. I&#39;ve also been living in New Zealand for quite a while during this time.

I work mostly on side-projects at the moment &amp;mdash; for a mix of reasons (learning new tech, learning SEO, building businesses, etc.). Occasionally I&#39;m writing articles around (bootstrapping) businesses. Looking forward to some interesting conversations here :slight_smile:
