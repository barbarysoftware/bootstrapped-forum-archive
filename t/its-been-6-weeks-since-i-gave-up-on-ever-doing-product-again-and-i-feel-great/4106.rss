    <description>A [very wise man](http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/users/ian/) once cautioned me not to spend $100k building something that would only ever generate $2k/month.  So, me being me, I promptly spent 3 years and $300k building things, and only ever generated $2k, total.

Ooops.  I guess I screwed _that_ up, huh?

I&#39;m not going to get into my long, twisty-and-turny product-flailing history in detail here.  Here&#39;s the TL;DR version:

* Had an idea for [a web app](http://www.smallspec.com) in 2012 &amp; started dev
* Produced [a pretty good podcast](http://www.chasingproduct.com) as I taught myself to become a product guy
* Scuttled my web app; 
* [Wrote &amp; shipped a book](http://www.record-and-release.com) instead, which tanked
* Started writing another book &amp; [launched an e-mail course](http://www.christopherhawkins.com) to drum up interest in it
* Finally got a clue &amp; quit

Another very wise man told me that deciding you _aren&#39;t_ going to do something is a discipline that few master.  So, I want to talk about that last &quot;finally got a clue &amp; quit&quot; bit.  And the reason why I want to talk about that is for anyone who may find themselves now where I was a short time ago.

So there I was.   My podcasting book had failed, I had just launched an e-mail course to drum up interest in my next book, and I was gearing up to do a podcast tour to drum up further interest in this new book.  I was depressed, feeling like a failure, and slogging forward on autopilot.

All of a sudden, I had a thought - &quot;To get to this point, I&#39;ve been passing up about $100k in consulting work each year.  If I had just skipped all of this and stuck to consulting, I&#39;d have an extra $300,000 in my pocket right now. I&#39;m passing up more consulting income with every second that goes by, just on the off chance that this next book will be profitable. I have no way to predict if it will be profitable or not, and - real talk - no real way to exert any control over that, anyway.  _Why am I still doing this_?&quot;.  

I realized, with a knot in my gut, that it was time.  Time to acknowledge my own failure.  Time to stop living out the Sunk Costs Fallacy.  Time to stop investing in something with no indication of return.  Time to take the old advice of &quot;dance with who brung ya&quot;.

It was time, in short, to return to the ONLY thing that EVER earned me significant sums of money - consulting.  But if I were going to make that move, I wanted to make it a *strong* move.

So, I started shutting product-related things down.

* My podcast of three years?  Done. I announced &amp; recorded the final episode within a week of my realization.  This one hurt. I loved that show.
* My podcasting book?  Done.  I quit promoting it; it had stalled months prior, anyway.
* My relatively new e-mail course?  Done.  I quit promoting that, too.
* My new book?  Cancelled.  I refunded the two pre-orders I&#39;d received, deleted the manuscript (so as not to be tempted to &quot;just finish it&quot;), and that was the end of it.

Now, this all freaked some people out.  Suffice to say there was no shortage of opinions on what I was doing, and most of them were convinced that what I was doing was wrong.
* A few friends and colleagues were pissed at me for &quot;throwing it all away&quot; (all what?).  
* A few others said they couldn&#39;t believe I was giving up when I was &quot;so close&quot; (close to what?).  
* One person said that if they had become as internet famous as I had become via my podcast, there&#39;s no WAY they&#39;d give that up (internet famous, my ass).  

Then there were the people who had known me during the dark years, the years of massive turmoil within my family, the years that culminated in me losing my way in every sense of the word, and scuttling my SmallSpec prototype out of sheer desperation.  Those people were not annoyed at me for giving up on product, no - those people saw what appeared to be me putting my affairs in order, assumed that I intended to commit suicide, and promptly freaked out.  That yielded some _really_ interesting conversations.  

But no, all I was doing was setting the stage for my return to full-time, full-focus, no-distractions consulting.  If I was going to be done with product, I wanted to be done.  No dabbling,  No lingering &quot;what ifs&quot;.  No having one foot on the brakes, just in case a good product opportunity came along.  Nothing.  Just consulting.

That was about 6 weeks ago.  Since I officially quit product, I&#39;ve:

* Re-activated several old clients
* Billed out 20x what I made from products in 3 years
* Completely revamped my website
* Written 5 new articles
* Made better than a dozen new, in-person contacts locally
* Been offered a chance to buy out another consulting firm

And that&#39;s just off the top of my head!

I feel alive again.  I feel like there&#39;s hope for my career again.  I feel like I&#39;m actually capable of making positive things happen again. I felt none of that during the product days.  Virtually every moment I spent trying to be Mr, Marketing Guy, trying to create and sell product, was sheer misery.  

Real talk - I&#39;m sure that if significant money had come rolling in, I wouldn&#39;t think of my product days as being _quite_ so miserable, but it didn&#39;t, so I do.  

Acknowledging my own failure and putting it behind me feels great, although I&#39;d be lying if I said I wasn&#39;t harboring any resentments about how my time as a product guy turned out.  But that&#39;s OK.  It&#39;s a process.

Man, I&#39;ve written way more than I had planned to.  What was my point, again?  Ah, yes - people who also find themselves where I was not too long ago.

If you have followed all the advice &quot;they&quot; gave you, and still aren&#39;t seeing any results...
If you have invested, invested, invested your time &amp; energy to no returns...
If you have been called a &quot;complainer&quot; for observing that the advice you were given isn&#39;t working...
If your finance are threadbare, and you have a way to make money other than product...
If you are starting to doubt your own abilities, despite a track record of success prior to product...
If your life is worse than it was before you told yourself you had to do product...
If your sense of optimism and confidence has turned to pessimism and self-doubt...

...give yourself permission to quit.  Especially if you have a viable money-making alternative.

That&#39;s crazy, right?  Bear with me for a minute, here.

We chase product (see what I did there?) in order to have _better_ lives, not worse.  If things are getting worse and worse and worse with no indicators of any kind of impending upswing,  give yourself permission to quit.

Don&#39;t quit, necessarily.  Just _give yourself permission_.  And think - _really think_ - about what you&#39;re doing, and why, and what direction it&#39;s really headed in.  Be honest with yourself in ways that you aren&#39;t (or don&#39;t think you can be) when people you know are around.  You don&#39;t have to follow any script, not even one you wrote for yourself.  You have permission to take it in any direction you want, and that&#39;s the important thing here - realizing that you have choices.

If you&#39;re out there chasing product and you&#39;re making it work, and you&#39;re seeing either returns or indicators of impending returns, good for you.  Keep on banging.  I&#39;m never going to say that just because I couldn&#39;t make it happen, you should quit, too.  But I will say that if &quot;the writing is on the wall&quot; as clearly for you as it was for me, take a minute to read that writing and really think about what it means.

The rest of your life might thank you.  Mine already is.</description>

            <p>I think that’s a good idea.<br>
I will caution you that 100 people is not a statistically valid sample. AND be aware that people don’t tell the truth (intentionally or not).</p>
<p>The best test is people agreeing to pay you money. Literally putting their money where their mouth is.</p>
<p>So, spending $2K on an MVP is an inexpensive way to get much better data than surveys.</p>

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>Being one of those 4 people that purchased your book I’ll give you my 2 cents of what i’d try.</p>
<p>The book is written, it’s not going anywhere, keep it up and available</p>
<p>What i’d do with it…</p>
<p>Condense it down in to a lead generation tool, I’d include the what but only a little of the how and stick it on Amazon as a either a free ebook or a low cost ebook ($1.99 or less).  It would of course contain lots of references to your website where they can find info on and buy one of the extended packages.</p>
<p>have one or two free downloads e.g. a checklist and a list of tools (with links to audacity downloads etc) that are available at the cost of signing up to the newsletter/giving you their email address (with verification of course) so you can start building your tribe.</p>
<p>Split the full book in to the condensed ‘what’ version and pull the ‘how’ bits out in to ‘courses’/‘tutorials’ that are included on purchase of a podcast ‘package’.  Same/improved content just repackaged, books are seen as low cost cheap items, courses have a better perceived value.</p>
<p>host a forum somewhere to build a community and do a monthly/bi-weekly newsletter with a summary of answers from the forum or a tutorial / review of a tool useful for podcasting.  Let the community generate content ideas etc for the newsletter.</p>
<p>If the sales go up, maybe start a blog and ‘new podcasts’ review</p>
<p>hopefully there are some ideas there.</p>
<p>good luck with whichever way you go.</p>
<p>Dean</p>

            <p>Yeah, consulting brings in good money. Recent years were especially good, 2015 being the most I ever made in consulting.</p>
<p>That however is not going to last forever - my capabilities, my availability, my mental sharpness will all degrade in the next 10 years, and I will be still some 10 years from retirement. And what if I get seriously sick?</p>
<p>A product then is a risk hedging.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Now, what I see in the OP story are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lack of focus</li>
<li>A lack of planning/efforts at SmallSpec delivery</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the things that should have been fixed: shut down podcast, book, whatnot. And then focus on SmallSpec.</p>
<p>No need to blame some unnamed “them” giving startup advises - it is the lack of or misplaced efforts that caused the lack of results. That’s especially sad because the SmallSpec could have been a very useful and even successful application – in many companies specs are still built in Excel with following versioning, tracking etc etc etc problems.</p>

            <p>Simply put: either your idea or your execution wasn’t good enough. FYI: As for whether it is doable for an ISV to get a SAAS business off the ground in the present day. We’ll yes! it is not only doable, but there are many thousands of ISV’s out there achieving similar outcomes. They just established more realistic and fruitful niche.  Getting a SAAS business off the ground is difficult. You have to be creating real value, otherwise it wont work. I think one of the clear signs for me: after launching your product, if it doesn’t work within the first four to six months, it probably wont ever. Its best to cut your losses and move onto the next idea.</p>

            <p>Selling info-products it’a all about marketing, so you can’t blame something else for this. There are shitty ebooks that sell in  millions because of good marketing and very good ebooks not selling at all.</p>
<p>Any SaaS that reached 50k MRR within 2 years either had investment, already built audience or on some level disrupted the market. If you are starting a SaaS for an established market, you can’t expect that unless your product is amazing compared to competitors or you have investors.</p>
<p>You purely failed at marketing, not on product or anything else. You’re just not a marketing guy(be perfectly fine with that)  and this affected you big time. Of course, non-marketing guys can succeed, but it’s hard and luck “level” needs to be higher.</p>
<p>Somehow I’m feeling that you’ll get back on the product “thing” pretty soon after the initial excitement of getting back to consulting dries out.</p>
<p>I think I launched 10 products over the years and only 2 had some relative success. What differs from the others:</p>
<ul>
<li>scratched my own itch</li>
<li>already had an audience</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t know how big your audience is, but you CAN launch a product(not an ebook) for them and do well. Look at WPcurve. Worked 1 year on a failed product but Dan built an audience during this time. Thanks to his audience, it was easy to get where is now, otherwise it would have been really hard.</p>

<p>The problem, I think - and I completely fell into this - is the way marketing messages and the startup press encourage us to redefine success as “whatever it is that I don’t currently have”</p>

</aside>
<p>The whole of consumer culture is based on convincing people that what they have is never enough. I try my best to ignore its siren call. But its a constant struggle when you are trying to fight against a message pushed by the slick marketing machines of multi-billion dollar corporations and your genes (your ancestors that were happy with what they had were probably selected against). At least if you do marketing, you can spot how and when you are being marketed too.</p>

            <p>You’re right, there are plenty of people who manage to pull it off without much, if anything, in the way of a tribe.  That warms my heart, because so much of product marketing these days is a tough road to walk when you don’t already have a following.  But I’m guessing that having a strong tribe never made it <em>harder</em> for anyone!</p>

            <p>Hey Chris, I see a lot of introspection on your part here. This is very useful, don’t lose that thread. You are examining why you made the decisions you did and surprise, you were marketed to…</p>
<p>Taught to be unhappy with what you had.</p>
<p>Wanting something better.</p>
<p>You learned the hard way, but you learned. Good luck in consulting.</p>

            <p>Yeah, and that’s certainly the frustrating part (and what I think of as “entreporn”) -</p>
<p>Everyone’s path to success is specific to their situation (and often full of luck). Most advice is given as “do this, not that” (it gets the clicks!), but reality of course is gr(e|a)y, not black or white.</p>
<p>(Also, don’t take “aggressive, sociopathic use of networks” too literally. I should probably tone down my rhetoric :D)</p>
