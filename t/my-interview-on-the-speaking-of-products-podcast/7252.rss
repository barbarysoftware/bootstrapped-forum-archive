    <title>My interview on the &quot;Speaking of Products&quot; podcast</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/my-interview-on-the-speaking-of-products-podcast/7252</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s [a podcast interview where I get to be the guest instead of the host](https://www.speakingofproducts.com/episodes/steve-mcleod).

Dan Miller and I talked about the basics of SEO for small software products.

I was able to drop in the irrelevant but slightly interesting fact that New Zealand (where I was born) and Spain (where I live) have cities that are [true antipodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes#Cities).</description>
