    <title>Creators Log Launched Today</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/creators-log-launched-today/3500</link>
    <description>Hello all,

Launched a new project today:
[Creators Log: A community of Creators][1] 

Creators Log is a place for creators to document and share their product creation journey with others.

Been in the works a couple of month, but got on [Product Hunt][2] today.

Would love to know what everyone thinks of it.

Cheers,
Mubs
