    <description>Hey all!

My name is Jure and I&#39;m an iOS/Rails developer building [Viaemail.me][1]. 

Like the title says, I love sustainable businesses/products and I trully believe that you can make a difference with a small product that solves a specific problem. As long as it does that good enough, you can ask for money from your customers and you can grow your business from there. No VC money needed! :smile:  

Anyway, I&#39;m building Viaemail and we kinda &quot;pivoted&quot; (although I hate that word) very early on because I had a chance to talk with Jusin J. and he pointed out some really cool stuff which made us focus on a community we&#39;re closer to. What do you guys think? Any feedback would be awesome. :smile:

Thanks and I&#39;m really happy to be a part of this amazing community of like-minded people!
