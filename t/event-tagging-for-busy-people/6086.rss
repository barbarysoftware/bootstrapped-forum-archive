    <description>HI!

I&#39;m Stan from hitmetrics.

We are testing waters with new service, Custom event tagging for business people. At hitmetrics(.)io, we deal a lot with tagging implementations, and it is hard to get it right, that is why we spend a lot of time perfecting custom tagging implementations for our clients.

We decided to create a solution specifically for custom event tagging for Google Analytics, Mixpanel or any other tool you might be using on your site. If you are looking for quick, extremely simple custom event tagging implementation, check it out: pointandtag(.)com</description>
