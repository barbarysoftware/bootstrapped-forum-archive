    <title>My Vat-Moss experience so far</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/my-vat-moss-experience-so-far/2497</link>
    <description>Till now, I sold my book via Gumroad. They had told me they&#39;d add support for VATMOSS.

So I was very disappointed when I got an email saying that their support was, basically, don&#39;t sell to Europeans(seriously), or get an Excel file with country of sales, leaving you to do all the tax calculations yourself. This is very disappointing, and it means I&#39;ll have to dump Gumroad (as I just can&#39;t sit there doing VAT for 200 countries).

I liked Gumroad because of how easy they were to setup, but now have to find a new seller.

I looked through @rachelandrew list (http://rachelandrew.github.io/eu-vat/third-parties.html) to see if I could outsource the Vat collection.

The first link there belongs to FastSpring, who look like they solve the problem for you. Another advantage of Fastspring is that they accept Paypal too. But, they are the exact opposite of Gumroad (in terms of user friendliness). You have to register with them, and then wait for a sales agent to call you back before you can start selling. o_O 

They&#39;ll probably ask me to fax my company details to them next, or send a horse rider with the contract. &quot;*Hear Ye, hear ye, here be thy contract to sell via FastSpring, thou farmer*&quot;.



The next one, Avangate, are similar, though they ask a lot more questions for even registering (and again the salesman will all you back), so I didn&#39;t even bother.

In the remaining list, PayHip and Paddle looked the best. PayHip was the easiest to get started with, but don&#39;t offer recurring solutions yet (they are pure eBook sellers). Paddle do. I&#39;ve registered with both of them, as they both look good.

I&#39;ll let you know how it goes.</description>

            <p>I’m seeing increasing numbers of companies who are choosing to go down the, set up a call with our agent route. My first thought was that this is annoying and must hurt sales. Having spoken to a few people who have started doing it, they have said one reason they do it is to pre-define their customers. They don’t want people with limited budget who will only cause them support issues for limited return. Their judgement was that the market they have is split between highly profitable larger enterprise types  and cheapskate smaller cos. The smaller ones don’t get beyond the leave details stage.</p>
<p>(Obviously it makes a huge difference depending on the type of product you have). Fastspring may just be managing their pipeline.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So, at the end of 2017 I looked into the conversion costs from Fastspring to my EUR account.<br>
Basically, by using direct deposit I pay about 1.3% to 1.4% conversion cost (~i.e. for 100 USD I receive 98.7 USD converted to EUR at interbank rate)</p>
<p>If I would switch to transferwise borderless, then I had to pay the USD - EUR fee of 1% + a withdrawal fee of EUR 0.60.</p>
<p>Given this, at least for me, it is not worth the hassle to switch.</p>

<p><strong>Borderless is not Transferwise</strong>, they are different products. I asked their support about this. The “no” page is the Transferwise page you are referring to. Their reply…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are correct that the ‘No’ page is not related to Borderless. This is for our regular transfers that are made from one currency to another.</p>
<p>Payments from third parties are only allowed if our customer has a Borderless account with us. With Borderless, you can receive third party payments from wherever you would like using your Borderless account details. You can have a bank account in four currencies: AUD, USD, EUR and GBP.</p>
<p>However, payments from Stripe, Paypal, Amazon, eBay, UpWork and other payment service providers will depend broadly upon how the transfers are sent. In order to see if you can receive payments from Fast Spring, please consult with them to find this out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, anyone can pay into your bank account as long as they meet the criteria at <a href="https://transferwise.com/help/article/2811598/borderless-account/what-type-of-payments-can-i-receive-into-my-borderless-account" rel="nofollow noopener">https://transferwise.com/help/article/2811598/borderless-account/what-type-of-payments-can-i-receive-into-my-borderless-account</a>. In most cases they can’t do international transfers into the Borderless account - only domestic.</p>

</aside>
<p>Where you able to actually do this ?</p>
<p>I had similar idea of using TransferWise account with Stripe to avoid forex costs, BUT per my research found 2 things -</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>TransferWise charges ‘Mid-Market’ rate ( which IMO is best in the market),  it is ~ 0.35 to 1%  which is less than next best , Stripe which last I checked charges 2%. So effectively you will save some % on forex. Whether 1 % to 1.35 % saving is worth the hassle  of having to deal with 2 different financial entities I guess will be based on individual use case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>( deal breaker) TransferWise does not accept money if the sender is not you ? I might be totally off on this one but  it would be helpful if someone with experience could provide input. I am assuming  TransferWise will treat FastSpring similar to Stripe.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yup, I was just going to chime in with that. Currency conversion is a big factor. I have also done the sums without currency conversion (try it) and, especially with subscription management (dunning etc.), it just wasn’t worth my time to try and figure all that out and then maintain a whole system. Even if it is WooCommerce or something like that, time is money so don’t let the lower price-tag fool you (more on this in a moment). On the low-volume, big-ticket items, sure - they will be manual most of the time anyway. If I get more than a handful of EU sales that I have to collect VAT on then I’ll probably follow the Quaderno route. My stuff is B2B so most of my prospects will have a VAT number.</p>

            <p>The spreadsheet costs for e.g. Fastspring vs Stripe/Quaderno hinge on the currency conversion costs.<br>
You can substantially lower these costs by using a transferwise account.  Basically the payout from Fastspring to you won’t incur conversion costs.</p>
<p>For me reducing the hassle of VATMOSS has quite some worth.</p>

<p>Per your sample annual sales spreadsheet FS is 200% times more expensive ,so for example $ 3500  more than Q.<br>
But even if Q is selected and if at all there need be  an reasonable European accountant is hired to file the Vat Moss 4 times a year , it will still work out cheaper than paying 200% times more ( ie. reducing your total profit margin by 11% !) .</p>
<p>I am just thinking out loud, I have yet to begin the online selling journey  .</p>
<p>I would like to brainstorm the option of ’ <strong>Non % charging VAT tracking  system + EU Accountant</strong> ’  here with all of ya , who been doing this for a while , while I am just a newbie. So something like Q can do 90% of  VAT job and the rest 10 % that falls through crack + final due diligence could be done by accountant . Quickly did search on Gumtree UK and found some reasonable  accountancy firm ads.</p>
<p>Is the convenience of letting FS/ ( % based system) handle everything about VAT worth a sacrifice of 11% of  profit margin ?</p>
<p>Side conversation : Taxamo is another option I came across , but they don’t have pricing on their website , so I am assuming they must be expensive .They have some overlay on your payment page or something and they pay VAT on your behalf.</p>
<p>I am here on the west coast mate.</p>

            <p>Still haven’t launched. I plan on launching 2 products in the next few months, one at less than $100 which I will almost-definitely sell through FastSpring, particularly the subscription side of things. I’d rather pay them to manage all that than maintain an eCommerce site with subscription management, dunning etc. Ain’t nobody got time for that.</p>
<p>The other product, which is well north of $1k/yr, I will manage manually because the market isn’t huge, less than a hundred, probably. Well ,if it is more than that then that would be a good problem to have.</p>
<p>In both cases I will manage the license authentication myself. I bought Infralution and will tweak it because I have a few things I want  to add to it.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/amina">@Amina</a> If you do consulting, different rules apply.  Paddle, fastspring and avangagte offer help for e-service.  You can’t use them for consulting.</p>
<p>Normally (I’m not a tax advisor, so check) as a consultant you don’t charge VAT for your EU clients.  You put their VAT number on your invoice and the clients themselves have to do a reverse charge.  This also means you don’t have to do VAT MOSS.</p>

            <p>Thanks a lot for your response! Actually, I just got an answer from my local tax office and they said they would classify my business as “consulting”, but not e-service. And Paddle just confirmed that I can’t use their services. Do you have any Paddle and Fastspring alternatives in mind that can handle selling regular services and dealing with all kinds of sales taxes? I am looking into Avangate now, but I haven’t got any response from them yet. Now it seems to be easy to file VAT returns for EU clients, but I have no idea what to do when it comes to some international clients and all those extra GSTs. I’d rather use some kind of service than digging into all the regulations myself.</p>

<p>You still have to register for VAT, but you are not responsible for collecting VAT.  If you sell to paddle, they will use the EU reverse charge system.  However, if you use fastspring, you don’t have to do any VAT with them, because they are outside of the EU.</p>

<p>You are not selling with 0% VAT, you are selling without VAT to paddle and they are responsible for VAT.   So you also don’t need to do MOSS.</p>

            <p>Thanks a lot for your answer! It’s really helpful! But if I use Paddle, do I still have to register my company for VAT? I thought that it works so that I will be selling my product to Paddle (which is EU-based company, so it’s B2B transaction between me and Paddle, thus 0% VAT), and then they resell it to the real end customer. So Paddle submits VAT for the sale that they did, from their company’s name. And I sold my product B2B to Paddle, with 0% VAT, so I would assume that I still need to register this in MOSS? Or am I wrong?</p>
<p>And also another question: when I submit my income information to the tax office, do I need to show only what Paddle has paid me (like those monthly payments you get), or all the transactions that have been made to the end customer?</p>
<p>I am sorry if my questions look stupid, I haven’t even registered my company yet, just trying to figure out the tax thing. So I am completely new to this.</p>

            <p>Re: 1.<br>
We’re using Paddle — we’re a EU-based company — and also get a monthly payment from them.<br>
To justify that we already paid our EU VAT, we ask Paddle to provide us their reverse-invoice after each payment. Too bad we don’t get that invoice automatically, but well, it works fine for our accountant.</p>
<p>The invoice is basically a list of how many transactions you made in each currency, and how much VAT you owe, minus Paddle’s fees. And the total amount is what you actually get in your account.<br>
To make it clear: we don’t have to pay the VAT afterwards, the invoice just states how much VAT Paddle owes for us.</p>
<p>As a precaution and in addition to this reverse invoice, we also make an export of all the transactions of our sales, where we can see the country of each sale, and the gross + VAT + net amounts. Total of these should match with the totals on the reverse invoice.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can someone please explain how the VAT thing works with Taxamo/Paddle/etc?<br>
I am EU-based.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If I have registered my company (which I am obliged to do because I am getting money without working as a contract employee), and I get payments to my bank account , I am supposed to file VAT returns from that money. But if Taxamo/Paddle pay this for me, I assume they do it never mentioning me. How do tax authorities know that I am paying the VAT through a third company?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let’s assume that I have registered my company, and selling my products to e.g. Gumroad which is US-based. Then I don’t pay VAT, because I am selling from EU to US. And then Gumroad re-sells my product and pays all the necessary VATs. But since I am constantly selling my products to the US-based company, doesn’t it mean that I have to inform US tax authorities, because my “customer” is always US-based? They have some super complicated nexus-system which brings me to the point where I have to figure this whole nexus thing out instead of VAT…</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please tell me I misunderstand something and it is not that complicated.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: it’s GBP1,495 to set up + 5% per transaction, on top of gateway charges. It looks like they binned their existing API service, I can’t find it on their site.</p>
<p>This is Obviously not aimed at startups, you’d have to be earning well already to justify that, and have your own CRM, automated emails, Dunning etc systems in place. So why would you switch away from Paddle, Gumroad, whatever, when you’re at that stage?</p>
<p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/polimorfico">@polimorfico</a> - you should landing page the hell out of that, they just handed their market to you.</p>
<p>The way I think this will pan out of me is very similar to <a class="mention" href="/u/stevemcleod">@SteveMcLeod</a>’s story: Start with FastSpring, wait &amp; see if there are any major income leaks that I actually have the resource to plug, plug them. I’d imagine it would be AUS, EU &amp; UK sales so Quaderno would solve that nicely. Everything else stays at Fastspring. I also imagine that will be a very, very long time coming, I would have to replace all of the features and integrations that someone like FastSpring offer. That is no small task.</p>
