    <title>Dosh - Stripe payment notifications for Chrome</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/dosh-stripe-payment-notifications-for-chrome/4858</link>
    <description>Making your first Stripe sale feels good. So much so that you find yourself gazing over the Stripe dashboard, partly in awe at your ability to turn code into cash. And partly to ensure there&#39;s hasn&#39;t been a stampede of cancellations or failed payments.

Instead of having to visit Stripe to know what&#39;s up, why not let the updates come to you?

That&#39;s the idea behind [Dosh](https://dosh.fr): _A Chrome extension that notifies you whenever anything interesting happens in your Stripe account_.

I built it because I know I&#39;ll use it daily, and think it might be of value to people here too.</description>
