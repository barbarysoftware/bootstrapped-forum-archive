    <title>How to measure and improve your SaaS content (and why you should bother)</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-to-measure-and-improve-your-saas-content-and-why-you-should-bother/6028</link>
    <description>Last time I posted here I was asked some great questions:

* How do you tell if your content is working effectively?
* What makes good content for SaaS products?
* How much content do you need?

So I&#39;ve written an article that covers all three topics: [How to measure and improve your SaaS content (and why you should bother)](https://contentedstrategy.com/blog/2018/09/21/Content-strategy-for-saas.html)

Thanks to @SteveMcLeod for his valuable input – I look forward to more comments.</description>

<p>Rather than the possibly-triggering word <em>simple</em> can you go directly to what the customer said and call-out things like <em>don’t wait through a sales call</em> or your hyper-focus on feature tracking?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s a good point. We are definitely highlighting the “no sales call needed” and “do one thing well” points in our copy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m stewing over this at present for a non-SAAS product trying to pick the wording to convey simplicity with deep power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also tend to stew over this stuff way too much. It is so easy to change content on the web if it is not working for you, and yet I still often get paralysed with indecision about this stuff.</p>
<p>Have you surveyed your customers to find how they describe your product? It is an extremely useful process.</p>

</aside>
<p>I wonder if there’s a <em>marketing perversity</em> if <strong>you</strong> are using the words though - is there any kind of signalling effect?</p>
<p>Rather than the possibly-triggering word <em>simple</em> can you go directly to what the customer said and call-out things like <em>don’t wait through a sales call</em> or your hyper-focus on feature tracking?</p>
<p>Simplicity is a virtue which makes you feel good about having picked a product and may be an unexpected delight. However, if given too much prominence in product copy, I worry it downgrades the experience.</p>
<p>As a test of messaging bias - how many less-successful competitors use terms such as <em>simple</em> and <em>easy</em> in their copy? We often forget to look at the failed campaigns.</p>
<p>(I’m stewing over this at present for a non-SAAS product trying to pick the wording to convey simplicity with deep power.)</p>

            <p>I’ve been using <a class="mention" href="/u/smokingpun">@smokingpun</a>’s services to help improve the content on the Feature Upvote website. We’re gradually rolling out the changed pages.</p>
<p>As part of the process, we sent two short surveys about how they found us and why they chose us (or didn’t choose us): one to active customers and one to people on our mailing list who created a trial account and didn’t convert to a paid account. We then used the results to change our site content.</p>
<p>I was surprised by what most customers said about us:</p>
<ul>
<li>it was quick and straightforward to get started with us. In contrast to our big competitor, we don’t force people to get a sales call nor to sit through a demo.</li>
<li>they like that we focus on one main task: feature request tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>This made it clear what to highlight in our copy. I had been trying to avoid words like “simple”, “easy”, and “straightforward” because I thought they carried little weight. However we now know that this is what our potential customers are looking for.</p>
