    <description>Hey there,

I just launched my new project: TempEmailify a browser extension for **Quick** short-lived email accounts for free.

tempemailify.versoly.page

Thinking about the problems I use to face while building web applications. I took my note, started listing out problems and the solutions I used at that time. By analyzing I found a simple problem on the usability of temp-email extensions.

It turned out to be a problem worth solving that led me to the idea for TempEmailify!

Any feedback is more than welcome!</description>
