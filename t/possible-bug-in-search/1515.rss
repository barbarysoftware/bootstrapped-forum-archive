    <title>Possible bug in search</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/possible-bug-in-search/1515</link>
    <description>So I searched for something. The first link I clicked on wasn&#39;t useful, so I went to the search bar again. But it kept showing me answers from the current question only. So it did something like:

hash# 1 (first answer)
hash# 2 (second answer)
...
and so on. Every search result was pointing to the same question.

I went back to the main page, and it was still doing the same thing. I had to reload the page three or four times before it let me search properly. 

And it keeps doing that, making search very difficult.</description>

<p>Note that searching on a long topic will prioritize matches in that topic, searching on a user page will prioritize matches by that user, searching in a category will prioritize matches in that category, etcetera.</p>

            <p>It’s not doing that for me. What OS/Browser combo are you using? (cc <a class="mention" href="/u/system">@system</a>)</p>
