    <title>Online marketing 101? Halp!</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/online-marketing-101-halp/2566</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;m a developer. I can develop products (SaaS&#39;s, plugins, apps whatever) and I can setup good looking landing pages. Problem is: If my landing page converts well, I won&#39;t know why. If my landing page does not convert well, I won&#39;t know why.

I need tools. Tools to get information about my landing pages, tools to build e-mail lists, tools to test my assumptions and tools to... You get it. I also need to know how to use these tools.

I can put a Google Analytics tracking code on my sites. And I do. But honestly, I don&#39;t really know what to do after that. And honestly, I don&#39;t really like Google Analytics and would prefer something simpler.

Anyways. All this stuff is a bit intimidating and I bet that some of you guys have some awesome resources that you can recommend for getting started with this stuff!

Please halp! :sweat:</description>

            <p>Howdy. More important that the tool is knowing what you need to track to make better decisions.</p>
<p>In your case, knowing which marketing efforts/channels are driving conversions is likely Step 1.</p>
<p>To that end, GA is <em>fine</em>. It’s super flexible and customizable - but that obviously comes with a complexity cost in the UI.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener">UTM tag</a> your marketing, set up <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1032415?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener">a goal in GA</a> and either use Acquisition &gt; Campaigns to see goal conversion rate by source or (and this is better), <a href="http://axiomaticllc.com/segmenting-audience-google-analytics/" rel="nofollow noopener">set up segments</a> for your most prevalent channels so you can dig into all the data around a conversion.</p>
<p>By far the biggest thing that’s helpful as far as web analytics goes is being curious and making the time to just tinker.</p>
<p>And if you don’t have the time to tinker, at least take <a href="http://axiomaticllc.com/5-minute-google-analytics-spot-check/" rel="nofollow noopener">five minutes a week</a> to make sure everything’s still running.</p>
<p>Hope that helps, and feel free to shoot me a message or email if it gives you any gruff or if you have some specific questions.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not sure you really need to worry about any of that stuff until you are getting a reasonable volume of traffic to your site. I would concentrate on trying to get targeted traffic to the site first. If you can’t do that, none of that other stuff really matters.</p>

            <p>A few suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some sort of <strong>screen recording  /heat-map software like</strong> <a href="http://CrazyEgg.com" rel="nofollow noopener">CrazyEgg.com</a> (there are lots  and many provide 1,000 or so recordings per  month)</li>
<li>
<strong>Put the bare minimum on the Landing page and then hide more info which is revealed by a Learn More button</strong> and track that with Analytics. This gives you micro-analytics.  BTW, you MIGHT fine something like <a href="http://Mixpanel.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Mixpanel.com</a> or KissMetrics to give you more of a “funnel oriented” results. For example, I  tested a new landing page and it was MUCH better. Then I looked closely and found that the CAUSE seemed to be that the new page promoted our intro video more. And when I looked I found that people who watched the video converted at 50% higher (to free trial) and engaged about 400% higher. I was able to do that b/c of the excellent analytics of Mixpanel (which is free up to a certain limit which we have not yet hit)</li>
</ol>
