    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Mark Littlewood from Business of Software Conference</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-mark-littlewood-from-business-of-software-conference/201</link>
    <description>I run the [**Business of Software Conference in Boston**][1]. We aim to bring some of the best bootstrapped software entrepreneurs from around the world together to talk about how to build great products and build great businesses.

Most of the talks we produce are put online to view and share.

Great initiative Ian.

            <p>More cowbell? Hmm, I don’t know. I never really consider how to make it better as I always have a great time. I’ll let you know if I come up with something <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>Great to have you here! I’m really excited about the Business of Software conf this year. I guess this will be my 4th or so time going. It’s definitely my favorite conference. The content is always great, but for me it’s the best mix of people and certainly is in keeping with our themes here on the <a href="http://bootstrapped.fm">bootstrapped.fm</a>.</p>
