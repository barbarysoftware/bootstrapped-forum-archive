    <title>Added new feature to bastions, would love feedback</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/added-new-feature-to-bastions-would-love-feedback/5816</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I added a new feature to bastions which effectively pivots the product into a broader market. I would love your feedback on the new homepage/new feature (new feature seen in the &quot;Create tests with a click&quot; section of the homepage).
