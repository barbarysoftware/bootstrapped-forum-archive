    <title>The Who&#39;s Who of the Micro-ISV World</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/the-whos-who-of-the-micro-isv-world/541</link>
    <description>For a long time I&#39;ve wished there were a list somewhere of all the micro-ISV people out there (patio11, Amy Hoy, etc.) but as far as I know, none exists. I hope I&#39;m not being overly ambitious, but I decided to write such a thing myself:

http://www.jasonswett.net/the-whos-who-of-the-micro-isv-world/

If you&#39;re new to the bootstrapping/micro-ISV/micropreneur world, I recommend you check out that list. I sure wish I had had that last when I started out.

If you&#39;re already deeply involved in this scene, is there anything I missed? I&#39;m getting ready for the pang of guilt when I realize the &gt;= 1 super important people I left out.

If you&#39;re already on there (or not on there but should be), feel free to set me straight if I effed up your bio at all. I&#39;m more familiar with certain people on the list than others. I want this list to be like the definitive list of micro-ISV resources, so I&#39;m very happy to expand and/or edit anyone&#39;s bio if it would make the list more helpful for noobs.

Any feedback on the list is greatly appreciated. Thanks!</description>

            <p>Some older names to maybe add to the list - they might not be quite as active now, but their archives might be worth reading through:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alwinhoogerdijk.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Alwin Hoogerdijk</a> of Collectorz fame should probably be on that list, he has a blog focused on Software Marketing that covers A/B Testing &amp; advertising experiments.  His list of negative keywords to use with Google Adwords saved me a bunch of money.</p>
<p>Way back around the early 2000s Eric Sink / MicroISV era, Steve Pavlina was a huge name.  He’s since left the software industry to become a self help author / guru / marketer, but he wrote some articles about software marketing before he quit that got a lot of traction at the time.  Look for the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061028144233/http://www.dexterity.com/articles/" rel="nofollow noopener">Dexterity Articles</a> (his company was Dexterity Software), but you might need to look on <a href="http://Archive.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Archive.org</a> as he deleted them all as part of his self-reinvention.</p>
<p>Thomas Warfield still makes Pretty Good Solitaire, and had a blog called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041016040618/http://www.asharewarelife.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">A Shareware Life</a> which used to publish details of his marketing tactics &amp; day trading experiments.  He’s deleted most of it but there are archives on <a href="http://Archive.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Archive.org</a>.  He was introduced to me at one time as “one of the shareware millionaires”, though that might just mean he did $1M in online sales over a period of a decade or so.  He was doing A/B testing in the very early 2000s, setting up the equivalent of Google Analytics &amp; split tests in his downloadable Windows software so he could track the effectiveness of in-app marketing messages, which he would tweak between version updates.</p>
<p>Some of Tom &amp; Steve’s articles are in back issues of ASPects, the magazine from the Association of Shareware Professionals (now <a href="http://www.asp-software.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Association of Software Professionals</a>) that was available in PDF format.  Might not be a place to hang out now, but it was big in the pre-JoelOnSoftware era.</p>
<p>And now I feel old for posting this <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Brilliant idea - I’m always amazed how many people I haven’t heard of before that are so relevant. The internet’s a big place…</p>

            <p>Great list, but I think there’s an important person that’s missing in it: Eric Sink (<a href="http://www.ericsink.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ericsink.com</a>).<br>
I think he’s the one who coined the word, and he even did an experiment to see if the model was viable or not. Here’s one of his articles from 2004: <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/bos/Micro_ISV.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ericsink.com/bos/Micro_ISV.html</a></p>

            <p>Thanks, Ryan. Good idea about the book link; I added it. I also added everyone’s Twitter handles per someone else’s suggestion.</p>
<p>The design could probably use some work as well. The list is looking pretty cluttered now with all the links. Adding pictures of everyone might be nice, too.</p>

            <p>Wow, that’s a great list of folks that have influenced me over the past year or so. I personally got a lot out of Rob Walling’s book, “Start Small, Stay Small: A Developer’s Guide to Launching a Startup”. You linked to others’ books and you might want to add that gem to Rob’s description. <a href="http://www.startupbook.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.startupbook.net/</a></p>
