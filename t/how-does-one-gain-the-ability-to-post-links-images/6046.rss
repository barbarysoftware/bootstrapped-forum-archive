    <description>Trying to post about an upcoming launch I have to garner feedback, but not able to post links :thinking:.

I made my introduction post awhile back, how does one get the ability to post a link or images?</description>

            <p>Looks like I got upgraded since I turned on browser notifications <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/thinking.png?v=6" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:"></p>
<p>Alright, I’m good <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>As a note though it might be good to have a post somewhere about trust levels (didn’t know that’s what discuss calls them).</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
