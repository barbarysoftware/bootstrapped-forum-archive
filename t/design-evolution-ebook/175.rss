    <title>Design Evolution eBook</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/design-evolution-ebook/175</link>
    <description>A few weeks ago I read a little book by Josh Long - [Design Evolution][1] - and liked it so much I posted a [review on my blog][2]. Was just sending the link to someone who asked me a question and thought it might be a useful read for people here.

*Disclaimer: I&#39;ve written for Five Simple Steps before in the Pocket Guide Series, which is why I read the book in the first place but not why I recommend it!*
