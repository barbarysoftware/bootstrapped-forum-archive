    <title>How Atlassian does B2B sales</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-atlassian-does-b2b-sales/367</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s a short presentation by Jay Simons on how Atlassian built and scales their B2B self-service* sales process. I think a lot of us doing B2B here will find themselves in the description, but it&#39;s great to see that it&#39;s possible to scale this model:

*) Atlassian often points out that they don&#39;t have sales persons, but I&#39;m not sure how accurate this is. They do have *Customer Advocates*, who apparently mainly educate/support customers instead of trying to push/sell licenses. I guess it depends on your definition of sales person.</description>

            <p>Granted, this was more than a few years back, but when I worked on Wall Street, I did hear stories about an entire team of Atlassian “customer advocates” showing up regularly at a one company or another. After a bit of time, that entire company was outfitted with Jira, Confluence, and whatever else the customer advocates “advocated”. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
