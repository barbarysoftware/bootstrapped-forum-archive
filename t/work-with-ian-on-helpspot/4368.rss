    <description>Hey Bootstrappers!

I know many of you here are still working full time while pursuing your longer term ambitions. We just opened up a new position at UserScape for a Software Engineer. Everyone who works at UserScape is very entrepreneurial and it&#39;s a trait I really love to see in employees. 

If you&#39;re interested in doing meaningful work helping everyone from startups to large non-profits provide amazing support to their constituencies give it a look http://userscape.com/careers.html

Cheers,

Ian</description>
