    <title>Referal system for freelancers?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/referal-system-for-freelancers/2603</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s another random question/idea:

With LiberWriter, I briefly tried to provide basic editing services, but decided it wasn&#39;t a good idea: it&#39;s way too personal, the people doing it aren&#39;t easy to manage, and I wasn&#39;t going to make that much money from it anyway.

However, I still think that there&#39;s a bit of extra money to be made by referring customers to a few, vetted, qualified professionals in adjacent markets, like editing.

So what I&#39;m kind of grasping around for is a way to get a small referral fee from a select group of freelancers.  More than anything, it&#39;d have to be really easy to use.  I don&#39;t care if I get every last cent, but it&#39;d just be nice to get *something* for doing some research and finding some people my customers could interact with.</description>

            <p>Yeah I think until you reach a certain mass the value of being able to send your customers to a high quality freelancer for extras isn’t in your cut, but in them having a better experience with your product. We’ve done this for years with very good results. We don’t get a cut of the money, but the customer gets the full service consulting they want without us having to get into that business.</p>

            <p>I was considering trying to get copywriter to help with content for my saas. Wasn’t so much looking for a referral fee as just a good reliable person who would know my app well and be able to knock content out efficiently and for a predictable fee.</p>
<p>Haven’t really pursued it too far yet though.</p>
