    <title>Death of blogging as a marketing tool</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/death-of-blogging-as-a-marketing-tool/3599</link>
    <description>It was interesting on the latest episode of the podcast hearing Ian muse on how blogs are no longer very useful as a marketing channel.

Starting in 2008, I used to blog a few times a week, as a major way of promoting Poker Copilot. Then, suddenly, blogging stopped working for me. I could almost pinpoint a precise day in mid 2012 when that happened.

It had been the case that whenever I asked for feedback on a particular idea via the blog, I&#39;d get lots of comments. And then one day, suddenly, I&#39;d get between 0 and 1 comments. I checked and double-checked my systems, and all was working. But people simply stopped interacting with the blog. To prevent comment spam, I eventually turned off comments altogether.

Did blogging hit some saturation level? Did the rise of clickbait sites steal the traffic from people looking to kill time? I don&#39;t know.</description>

            <p>This was in reply to the "can’t build an audience with 400 word posts"<br>
I read, favorite, and share Patrick’s content on Twitter.</p>
<p>I also think that one should not look narrowly at just blogging, but rather look more broadly at Content Marketing. Twitter is one way to do that marketing.</p>
<p>Now, I will say that it’s crucial that your content:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be of <strong>interest</strong> (and ideally useful) to your <strong>target audience</strong>.</li>
<li>Ideally, educate that audience to <strong>overcome obstacles to using your service</strong>. (E.g., If I am selling UX design, I’d write about success stories with UX, or how important UX is, or how to know if your UX sucks. This has the benefit of particularly targeting that group of potential customers which is lacking some knowledge to use your service. It also establishes credibility with the exact thing you’re selling, and overcomes an obstacle (moves them closer to buying.</li>

            <p>Twitter posts, unless pointing to a blog post, are irrelevant in a discussion about blog posts, surely?</p>
<p>Shorter is certainly a good goal to aim for, but it’ll a well-worn truism, one that keeps defying trendy “updates” by gurus, that the more you tell, the more you sell. Blog posts are not sales copy but they must at least be interesting.</p>
<p>If you HAPPEN to have great, actionable and high quality content that you can cram into 400 words (less than a whole page) then go for it, but how often can you do that?</p>

            <p>I think Medium looks good on the outside for the same reason ipad apps do:<br>
They do a good job (I think) of meriocracy:They promote the best 1%, which is what we see.</p>
<p>Simply posting on Medium doesn’t get you into that top 1% <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slightly_smiling.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling:"></p>
<p>However, I think your best articles, Andy, <em>are</em> in the top 1%  It’s worth a “lean marketing MVP” try <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slightly_smiling.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling:"><br>
If you do it, let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>Hmmm… how about a medium article on posting on Medium, for microISVs?</p>

            <p><strong>I disagree.</strong></p>
<p>Patrick Mckenzie publishes great, pithy Twitter posts. Very high signal to noise on those.</p>
<p>At the very least, I think the goal should be as SHORT as possible (but no shorter).  There is WAYYYY too much wordy crap on the internet that has a 400 word nugget of good stuff.</p>
<p>If it’s really interesting and well written, especially <strong>if the fluff moves the story forwar</strong>d, then that works. Like JoelOnSoftware.  There’s a big difference between telling a funny anecdiote that illustrates your point, and just telling a mediocre random anecdote.</p>

            <p>Yep. I think there’s a lot more noise today (possibly from the puff pieces).  Which makes the good stuff actually stand out even more.</p>

            <p>As a reader, (Yes, I do read, folks) Medium is very appealing. I would highly recommend it as a marketing ploy. I don’t read many blogs exclusively, but I do read medium almost daily.</p>

            <p>I can’t imagine ever not writing articles.  But I’m not sure that writing articles is equivalent to blogging.</p>
<p>Whether blogging has declined in popularity due to the shift to mobile or the death of RSS or something else, long-form content will always have a place in content marketing, even if it’s more as an adjunct to e-mail courses or lead magnets or paid ads.</p>
<p>Plus, it wasn’t all that long ago that podcasting was considered dead, and look at it now.  The wheel never stops turning.  No idea what tomorrow will bring, and all that.</p>
<p>I’ve been experimenting with posting stuff to both my blog and to Medium.  Medium gives me more reach.  My blog gives me the ability to capture opt-ins.  You would think the former would translate into the latter, but it’s not always so.</p>
<p>I’m just going to keep writing articles and figuring out ways to get them in front of people who need them.  Whether we call that blogging or not, whether we call that dead or not, I’m ust going to keep doing it and see how it goes. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I think a very focused blog <a class="mention" href="/u/bradt">@bradt</a> was talking about can definitely still work. I’m starting to wonder if your own blog is really the best place for it though. Basecamp just moved to Medium for their blog and it’s something I’m going to try also. My personal (most abandoned!) blog will remain, but I’m going to be putting more of my software business and general business stuff over on <a href="https://fasterhorses.io">https://fasterhorses.io</a> for a bit (not much there yet! soon!).</p>
<p>I also think for me, having a built in audience on Medium (via Twitter) gives me a bit more motivation to write. Well, that’s my theory anyway. I have a few interesting articles in process, I’ll report back on if Medium seems to help with any traction.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Have you considered the shift from PC to mobile?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, that makes sense as a contributing factor. The rise of mobile kills comments but also easy use of RSS subscribing, combined with the explosion in “professional” blogs and full time blogs, content farm (eg “10 amazing things to do before you die, <span class="hashtag">#4</span> will surprise you”), and facebook becoming a default go-to site for bored people all combined to make blogging less effective. That’s now my premise!</p>

            <p>Have you considered the shift from PC to mobile? I haven’t looked but if there was a huge uptake in mobile devices in 2011(ish) that could contribute to less comments on blogs that are not mobile friendly - or more specifically - ones with commenting systems that are not mobile friendly.  In general, typing anything more than a sentence on mobile sucks.  I personally do not comment much on my phone.  Food for thought.</p>

            <p>I hate blogging, but that’s because I don’t like writing in English. I’m pretty sure blogging works very well, but have you tried “side project marketing”? Making free tools, related to your main product? For a team is more exciting to launch fun side project, maybe even monthly, than writing a long blog post.</p>

            <p>Are you letting users sign up for a newsletter so they get notified of the new articles?<br>
Have you considered a specific “course” (or “series”) on “improving your poker skills?”</p>
<p>I suspect there are potential customers out there who are casual players who want to be better but don’t know what the path is. Once they get serious THEN they might love PCP.  Your free course could jazz them up about it.   I really see a lot of potential here for that. And I assume you LIKE poker, so it’s research you’d enjoy.</p>
<p>Surely there must be podcasts and blogs on “improve your poker skill”. If not maybe that’d be a good thing to experiment with (not easy I know <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>I’ve indeed already changing the aim of my articles. I’ve put them on our main website, and not on the blog. I’m definitely changing the nature of articles for the future.</p>

            <p>Let me know if you tried any of the things I suggested.</p>
<p>We are definitely getting traffic to our website from the blog (and I don’t even push the product. I just mention it in the bio. And we have at least one subscription directly attributable. (Compare that to Adwords, which netted us 2 paying subscriptions in several months ($400 worth of ads).</p>

            <p>If you are going to post fairly regularly (1/ month or more) I highly recommend you make it sticky by having a newsletter that announces it.</p>
<p>It costs zero to have a Mailchimp list of up to 2,000 subscribers.</p>
<p>Wow, Andy, that is some killer traffic on your blog.</p>
<p>Something to bear in mind is that  <strong>your blog needs to achieve several things</strong>: to monetize it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be of true interest to your target audience</li>
<li>establish your credibility in the area you are selling</li>
<li>Establish trust</li>
</ol>
<p>BONUS: if you can also educate them on the problem you are solving, that can accomplish all three above PLUS it promotes someone from the <em>“I didn’t realize what was causing my pain”</em> to “* I now understand the cause, how do I fix it”*  I.e., it converts non customers into customers.</p>

            <p>Even if blogging is not as good a marketing tool it is still very useful as a<br>
content generation tool. It is a bit discouraging when you write say  5 posts about a topic and you hardly see<br>
any traffic/comments on your website  but the effort does not go totally to waste.</p>
<p>At that point what works for me is extracting the good stuff/ideas out of the existing content<br>
remixing it and promoting it to our audience. The more content you write the more opportunity you have<br>
to find the good stuff, polish it and show it to your prospects.</p>
<p>Also I think less traffic of people who actually read is much better than people who come around to your<br>
website because they are bored.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/bradt">@bradt</a> thanks for the counterpoint. Is that extra traffic converting well into sales? I hope so.</p>
<p>It does seem like you’ve taken a professional approach. Maybe that is the reality of successful blogging today? That is, presenting well-argued, well-presented, well-directed content is much more important today than when blogging worked well for me in 2008.</p>

            <p>Blogging and promoting via email and social media has been working great for us. We just started in February and you can see the traffic impact…</p>

<p>My strategy was to produce high quality and relevant articles to our audience. Our audience is mostly developers, so our team of developers actually writes the articles on advanced topics that they would enjoy reading. Obviously the cost of an article is extremely high ($500-$800 USD), but it has definitely been worth it for us.</p>
<p>People have told me that they hire a writer for 5 cents/word but what I see from them is either a fluff piece or an amateur article. I think that’s the mistake. People don’t see value in those articles and will dismiss anything from you in the future. We’ve had plenty of people tell us they’re really looking forward to our next article. We’ve doubled our subscribers in 9 months…</p>

<p>The number of posts I write per month has dropped off a lot over time and I don’t allow commenting on old articles (to reduce spam), but it is suggestive that blog readers are commenting less. Maybe they comment on twitter instead?</p>
