    <title>How much does your app icon cost?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-much-does-your-app-icon-cost/5168</link>
    <description>I’m writing an article for Mass Media. We compare how much an app icon costs in different markets and what factors can influence the price. I need to find out how many time it takes to create an icon and whether customers conduct A/B tests. If you have your own app, please, answer some questions about the cost of your icon and I will share the results with you later.
This is a poll. You can answer only some questions but I ask you to answer all of them. Leave your email just if you want to know the results
So this is the Google Form I ask you to fill in

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11LgJNXfwQAl7NYlUaOZt3RdV06TKW2ou_BLK6GOLxfU/edit?edit_requested=true


Thank you for help!
If you know, how to spread this poll, please help me in my research.</description>
