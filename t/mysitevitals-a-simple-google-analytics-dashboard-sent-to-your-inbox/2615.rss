    <title>MySiteVitals - A simple Google Analytics dashboard sent to your inbox</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/mysitevitals-a-simple-google-analytics-dashboard-sent-to-your-inbox/2615</link>
    <description>Hey all -

My co-founder and I have built a Google Analytics dashboard that gets delivered to your inbox every morning called MySiteVitals -- http://mysitevitals.com/

In a nutshell, we decided that packaging the most essential metrics into an easy to read dashboard in your inbox would help open the door to GA for a much larger audience. And so MySiteVitals was born.

We&#39;d love for you to check out the site (and even sign up - it&#39;s currently being offered FREE!) and get your feedback.

Cheers,

Jeff</description>

            <p>Hey Jeff, just gave it a try—nice and easy, good work. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<p>I actually built a very similar product, for the same reason (it’s something I needed): <a href="https://briefmetrics.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://briefmetrics.com/</a></p>
<p>Feel free to give it a try and draw some inspiration for your own.</p>
<p>Some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a way to delete the account.</li>
<li>Add some smoothing for charts that are spikey, like bounce rates. Maybe a 3-7 day rolling average?</li>
<li>I like your mobile breakdown chart, but I’d love to see that long-term over time (one of the reports I’m working on does this, but it’s not launched yet).</li>
<li>Strip out “noisy” results, like referrals with just 1 visit. One of the biggest things I wanted out of Briefmetrics is to cut away the noise, so I’ve focused a lot on this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck! Let me know if I can help, feel free to shoot any questions my way. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
