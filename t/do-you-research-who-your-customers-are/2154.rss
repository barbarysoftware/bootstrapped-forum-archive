    <title>Do you research who your customers are?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/do-you-research-who-your-customers-are/2154</link>
    <description>By research I mean things like:

- Looking for their social profiles.
- Trying to know how big is their business (if you have a B2B business).
- Trying to discover where are they based...

Are you doing this kind of customer research? Why?</description>

            <p>Vibe is brilliant – thanks for the tip!  This is going to save me real time, and a ton of clicking around when prospecting (I was doing LinkedIn lookups by hand).</p>

            <p>Thanks for the links <a class="mention" href="/u/kadavy">@kadavy</a>. I’m trying to discover how common is for a business owner to use this kind of tools (or alternatively do this research manually) when receiving an email from a prospect or customer.</p>

            <p>Rapportive doesn’t work for me anymore. I’ve been using <a href="https://vibeapp.co" rel="nofollow noopener">https://vibeapp.co</a> instead.</p>
<p>Lurking around on social profiles can be helpful, but nothing beats long conversations with actual customers. I think Indi Young’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mental-Models-Indi-Young-ebook/dp/B004VFUOQ0" rel="nofollow noopener">Mental Models</a> outlines a great methodology for making these conversations useful.</p>

            <p>It is still working for me. I had a similar discussion recently and my (limited) research told me that only some Rapportive features (that I never used) were discontinued.</p>

            <p>Is Rapportive still working? I’ve read that, since LinkedIn bought it, it’s working worse:<br>

            <p>Consider using Rapportive. It gives you 80% just by entering the email address.</p>
<p>And yes, I do. It helps to know which target market you are already reaching and aim for new ones - or improve marketing for the existing one.<br>
For example, I think that <a href="http://www.linksspy.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.linksspy.com</a> is ideal for SEO agencies, but somehow a lot of bootstrappers and people with just 1 website ended up paying me. It’s good to know that, because it showed me that a) my marketing isn’t laser-focused towards SEOs b) there is some need for this product in other markets.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Christoph</p>
