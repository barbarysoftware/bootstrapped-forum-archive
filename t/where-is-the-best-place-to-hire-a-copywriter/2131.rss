    <title>Where is the best place to hire a copywriter?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/where-is-the-best-place-to-hire-a-copywriter/2131</link>
    <description>I need to hire a copywriter to help with a site I&#39;m working on. Are there any sites like yunojuno or pickcrew that cater to copywriters? If not, does anyone have any experience with a good copywriter they can recommend?</description>

            <p>I use oDesk for general hiring – loads of copywriters there, across all topics.</p>
<p>However, I’m using this brilliant tip I just read last week from <a class="mention" href="/u/itengelhardt">@itengelhardt</a> – look for bloggers who already understand &amp; write about your particular industry.  They will create better content in less time, and they already have an audience you can leverage.</p>
