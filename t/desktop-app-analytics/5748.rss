    <description>Hello everyone,

I&#39;m pretty sure most of us are familiar with and already use Google Analytics on our websites.

I was wondering though, for the devs building desktop apps what solutions, if any, you might be using to track your app&#39;s usage. Obviously taking into account that there are serious privacy concerns at play, that this data must be as anonymous as possible, the option to disable/enable it prominent and be opt-out by default. 

For our Windows c++ app, we&#39;re thinking of introducing anonymous data usage stats though we&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s worth the effort. We&#39;re thinking perhaps the usage insight we gain along with the feedback we&#39;re getting might help with improving the product. We&#39;re currently only tracking successful install + first run by opening a quick start guide page with tips and tricks which is not entirely accurate.

Some options I&#39;ve looked at briefly:
- Deskmetrics ( deskmetrics.com ), seems perfect but the project looks dead.
- Revulytics ( https://www.revulytics.com/revulytics-usage-intelligence ), not so sure about this.
- https://www.starmessagesoftware.com/softmeter, uses GA, haven&#39;t really looked into it.

Still not sure about any of them. What do you think?

Thanks</description>

            <p>You’re probably right, it would be best to use an in-house solution. Just figured it might save a lot development time to use an already existing solution.</p>

            <p>If I needed such a thing, I’d better build it myself. Just collect some stats that are important - how often certain menu items are clicked, what data amount used in certain areas, track software uptime etc.</p>
