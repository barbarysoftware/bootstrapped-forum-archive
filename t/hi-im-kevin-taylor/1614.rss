            <p>Hi Shantnu,</p>
<p>I learnt wordpress and built an MVP site over a weekend to test a concept, I wanted to know whether is was worth building a timber beam calculator, so I built a simple wordpress site for people wanting to timber ridge beam calculations, which would be one of the main applications of a timber beam calculator.</p>
<p>The site had a home page, and a calculation page, which consisted of a contact form and a paypal buy button. I spent $9.36 for the domain and 1 months hosting and spent £15.87 on Adwords, during the month I had 4 enquiries but no sales, so I abandoned the experiment.</p>
<p>I have built a new site using shopify <a href="http://www.structuralcalculations.io" rel="nofollow noopener">structuralcalculations.io</a>, to test a few ideas that I would later like to incorporate into my <a href="http://beamcalculation.co.uk" rel="nofollow noopener">beamcalculation.co.uk</a> site, I have had 1 sale through this site, so I am continuing with this experiment. Will let you know how I get on.</p>

            <p>Welcome, Kevin.</p>
<p>Some time ago, we were having a discussion if you could build a website on Wordpress. I know that you started one of your websites with WP. How’s your experience been, and are you still using WP?</p>
