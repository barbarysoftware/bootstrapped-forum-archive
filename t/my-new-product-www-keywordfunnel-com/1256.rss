    <title>My new product www.keywordfunnel.com</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/my-new-product-www-keywordfunnel-com/1256</link>
    <description>I have just launched my new product for Adwords advertisers:
http://www.keywordfunnel.com
It is a commercial quality version of a rag-tag collection of tools I created for my own use.

I wanted to get it out there ASAP, so I could start getting feedback. So I have tried to follow my own advice and resist the foul urge to do too much gold-plating.  Consequently the website is fairly minimalist at present. The software itself is well tested and robust though.

I would be very interested in any feedback.
-Do you understand what it does?
-Does it address a real pain point for you?
-Does the video + website look ok?
-Does the software download and install ok?
-Any issues/problems? </description>

</aside>
<p>Couldn’t agree more!  You want something that is generic enough to be a niche worth exploring and that is specific enough that the constraints don’t vary so much between customers. That is so difficult.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t generalize your product to fit other grouping problems. “Grouping problems” is just a too big thing. But maybe you can create other products for other niches with grouping problems, knowing that you may not reuse a lot of what you already have. Sports Tournaments is one… another pain that I saw often was assigning rooms to teachers/courses in universities.</p>

</aside>
<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>People have asked me why I don’t generalize my genetic algorithm to other grouping problems (e.g. sports tournaments). But the more generic something is, the more complex it becomes and harder it is to market.</p>
<p>I guess the trick is to solve a problem that lots of people want to solve, where the contraints don’t vary too much between customers. Saying that, different people do have quite different requirements for their table plans. Handling a 50 seat wedding, a 500 seat state banquet and a 4000 seat charity event in the same software is quite a challenge! Especially when you have all the cultural issues.</p>
<p>Choosing the best market is perhaps the ultimate optimization problem!</p>

            <p>I am in the early stages of looking for that elusive product-market fit, so all feedback is appreciated. I will email you off list.</p>
<p>I did a physics degree originally. Then my first job was in writing OR software (in FORTRAN!). PerfectTablePlan doesn’t fit into the classic OR mould and isn’t amenable to any of their standard approaches (e.g. linear programming) so I wouldn’t really consider it OR software. Also the solver is only a small part of the whole.</p>
<p>Keyword Funnel does have a tricky optimization problem in it. Partitioning keywords into adgroups automatically. That was the most challenging and fun bit to write. My first attempt to an hour plus to partition several thousands keywords. It can now do it in a few seconds. I don’t think there are many other pieces of software that can do this. Google has an online equivalent. But it is much less flexible.</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/andy">@Andy</a><br>
I am a SEO newbie and that is why I think I still do not understand  your product’s positioning relative to other solutions in the field (Long Tail Pro, HitTail, etc). I downloaded Keyword Funnel to understand it better and maybe help you more (if I can).</p>
<p>I am trying to use it and have some questions on how does it work. I don’t want to share this here… What is the best way to reach you and discuss the usage of KeywordFunnel? E-mail? My email is fredguth (at) fredguth (dot) com.</p>
<p>Another thing… I listened to you in the <a href="http://bootrapped.fm" rel="nofollow noopener">bootrapped.fm</a> podcast and discovered that you have an operations research background. I had a consulting software company in this area (not an operations research guy myself, though). We tried many times, but never succeeded in developing a product as you did.</p>
<p>I was wondering… in your second product, why didn’t you looked for another optimisation problem? (or maybe I am wrong and keyword funnel is an optmisation problem and I didn’t notice).</p>
<p>About Market Samurai, you can see it in action in one of Pat Flynn’s videos: <a href="http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/webinar-replay-100623/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/webinar-replay-100623/</a></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Watching the LongTailPro video, it looks very different in approach.</p>
<p>Keyword Funnel doesn’t have a built in database. You paste in potential keywords from from various sources e.g. analytics, adwords search reports, webmaster tools, the built in keyword multiplier etc and it helps you filter and group the keywords and then upload them straight into AdWords. LongTailPro could be used as a source of keywords for Keyword Funnel.</p>
<p>Keyword Funnel is also much cheaper!</p>
<p>I could find out anything much about Market Samurai without signing up (ick).</p>

<p>I see. Wasn’t clear immediately, too.</p>
<p>May be then you should consider to cross-promote KF to HitTail users and other way around? Integrate them somehow? HitTail is an established product with a sizable user base, which you may take advantage of.</p>

            <p>Much, much better. It’s clear what you are selling now. I havent seen the video because Im at work, so cant comment on that.</p>
<p>Only one tiny suggestion- the site could be made a bit more slick. That might be as simple as buying a good Bootstrap theme. But I’m not a designer, so take my advice with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>There is still plenty more work to on the site. Hopefully it is an improvement though. What do think?</p>

<p>Partly becuase I could develop much faster as a desktop product. But also I couldn’t really see any advantage to it being web based.</p>

<p>That all makes sense.</p>

<p>I agree. But I don’t think I can make any honest claims about doubling anything, yet. Hopefully I can think of some compelling copy without making up numbers.</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>This is for the future - it seems you need to educate the visitors a little bit about why longtail adwords are so good (cheaper and higher conversion rate). Instead of trying to do it all in one session through copy or a video, how about a multi part email course on “unlocking your lucrative long tail”? That way you can extend the relationship and they may come back to buy.</li>
</ol>

<p>An email course or PDF is something I am considering.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to reply.</p>

<p>‘LongTail’. Is that a another product?</p>

<p>Yes, the text needs to be clearer.</p>

<p>None expected. ;0)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Website and video seem to generally work<br>
Video is too long, and boring as all heck. It sits on one image for a long time. You speak clearly and slowly, that’s good. But move the tutorial bits of it to another video.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That feedback is coming through very clearly from various places. I knew the video was too long, but I just wanted to get something out there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“start your free trial” made me think SaaS. “Download your free trial” instead?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DMG folder is a bit too small to see everything without scrolling, on my MBP. See image.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to vary depending on the machine. not sure why. I’ll put it on the list to investigate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m currently using a sketchy Internet connection and having trouble with seeing all the video. Why are you self-hosting this? YouTube or Wistia is much better for hosting videos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will probably switch it to my <a href="http://screencast.com">screencast.com</a> account.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The app UI seems like it was created by a programmer. I think there is a lot of room for selective disclosure, smart presets, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to get something out there, rather than spend months polishing it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a retina MBP running Mavericks, the text in the app appears unsharp. It doesn’t look good. You might be able to fix this simply by adding this to the app’s Info.plist:<br>
&lt;key&gt;NSHighResolutionCapable&lt;/key&gt;&lt;string&gt;true&lt;/string&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is an issue with Qt 4. Making the change you sugget causes weird button sizing issues. I can fix it by moving to Qt 5. Perhaps for the next release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hope this helps…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes! Thank you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and btw: congrats on getting a new product out there!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks. It is pretty exhausting, especially when you have another product.</p>
