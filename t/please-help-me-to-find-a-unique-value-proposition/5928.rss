    <title>Please help me to find a unique value proposition</title>

    <description>Hey guys,

I want to build a platform where business owners can generate highly engaging and interactive courses for their products to onboard already existing customers or get new leads and turn them into happy new customers to grow their business.

I would like to do that as transparent as possible and with you together, because, well, it is supposed to be for you and right now I am trying to find a unique value proposition and would be very happy if anybody here who already uses content marketing for his or her product could take 3 min to help me with this short survey below.

Thanks. I love you all.</description>

<p>Thanks anyway and good luck.</p>

            <p>I started on the survey but it’s clearly for potential customers and I’m not one.</p>
<p>The thing with a USP is that it should be unique, and also somehow benefit the reader/buyer. What you’ve described is an elevator pitch, but not a USP.</p>
<p>What is unique about your platform or audience?</p>
