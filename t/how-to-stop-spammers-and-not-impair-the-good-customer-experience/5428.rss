    <title>How to stop spammers, and not impair the good customer experience</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-to-stop-spammers-and-not-impair-the-good-customer-experience/5428</link>
    <description>Hello,
  
  Recently we had to spend some time on fighting email spammers, who used &quot;Share&quot; function of [Checkvist](https://checkvist.com) to send emails with hand-crafted &quot;share note&quot;. 

  The summary of what worked for us is here: http://blog.checkvist.com/post/166940442968/how-to-stop-spammers-and-not-impair-the-good

   What did not work:

   - blocking spammer IPs (they have plenty resources, really)
   - adding limitations by a number of sent invitations (they created different lists, different accounts, removed and re-created invitations)
   - avoiding sending many emails to a particular domain (qq.com is the famous one).

  Maybe our experience will be useful to some of the people here :slight_smile:

  Best,
  KIR</description>

            <p>I hope they have not yet worked around invisible reCAPTURE as of 2017.</p>
<p>When this reCAPTURE is unsure if you’re a human you should identify some objects on several pictures. I don’t think it can be solved by IA yet. It may be cheaper to hire some poor mechanical turks to pass the capture than to use IA.</p>

            <p>So email verification and reCAPTCHA?</p>
<p>Spammers can verify the source emails, can’t they?</p>
<p>And reCAPTCHA… I do not really know how it works, but I recently heard a neural network was trained to work around reCAPTCHA.</p>
<p>So… do not relax as of yet.</p>
