    <title>#135: How to improve a B2B website’s content, with Hannah Adcock of Contented Strategy</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/135-how-to-improve-a-b2b-website-s-content-with-hannah-adcock-of-contented-strategy/6936</link>
    <description>Content specialist Hannah Adcock (@smokingpun) audited [Saber Feedback&#39;s website](https://saberfeedback.com/). In this episode, she tells us what&#39;s good about our site and what needs to change.

&lt;iframe height=&quot;200px&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; seamless src=&quot;https://player.simplecast.com/154ed302-ec5b-4b7f-a582-693eb54ae451?dark=false&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Hannah runs [Contented Strategy](https://contentedstrategy.com/). She was [on the podcast a few months ago](https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/bootstrapped-108-hannah-adcock-owner-of-contented-strategy/6563), when she talked about the benefit of a content audit.

In this episode Hannah is way more specific. She tears down the Saber Feedback website, section by section. And then she presents a plan for improvement.

<p>GitHub repo, using Markdown and Jekyll, hosted on Netlify.</p>
<p>A change to master gets detected by Netlify. Netlify builds the site and deploys it.</p>

<p>Matt has a copy of all the posts, to use as he sees fit. I believe he will be putting some of them up on his new blog.</p>

Thanks for letting us listen to your discussion.  I’ve got 1 question and a suggestion:</p>
<p>Steve said that the home page was now easily changeable.  How are you hosting this and making this possible?</p>
<p>And about the blog:  I understand that some of Matts post will be removed.  I think many bootstrappers (me included) liked reading Matt’s posts.  What do you think of giving the posts back to Matt, so he can put them on his blog and use the name Bugmuncher in the posts?  That means the information would still be online, but probably would have no SEO impact for you?</p>
