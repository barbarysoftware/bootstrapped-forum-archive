    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hello-its-me-valentino/6663</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, 
my name is Valentino I am a frontend-developer / designer, currently I live in Stuttgart. 
Professionally I started my own business as a classic internet agency about a year ago with two colleagues from my university, the name of our company is cyclus.digital GmbH. We are currently developing our own Headless CMS and are planning to publish our product next summer. The product is already being used by some of our clients. 

I am happy to have found a forum where like-minded people can share their experiences and ideas.</description>
