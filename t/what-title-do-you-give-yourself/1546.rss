    <title>What title do you give yourself?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/what-title-do-you-give-yourself/1546</link>
    <description>This is less a question about whether your business card says that you are the &quot;Chief Espresso Rockstar&quot; or similar, but moreover when you think about who you are and what you do, do you think of yourself more as a:

 - Entrepreneur
 - Bootstrapper
 - Founder
 - Micropreneur
 - Product/SaaS Owner
 - Independent Developer

Others? Just curious, because just about every time I tell someone what I do, I change it :)</description>

            <p>I prefer Chief Scapegoat privately.  Publicly, I don’t really use a traditional title, just “Owner” of the business.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/thedavecollins">@TheDaveCollins</a> I think “Google Whisperer” is twattier than CEO… <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<p>Reminds me of the time I work in a company as the first and only employee. I had three bosses, who were business partners. One was the CEO, one was the CIO, and one was the CTO. I was the only non CxO person in the company. It felt…well…twatty.</p>

            <p>“Google Whisperer”. I felt like a twat calling myself CEO (of a four person company), founder made me think of hide and seek, and Director made me feel evil. I may have issues.</p>

            <p>I use the title “Principal” in my email signature, but when talking to people I say “owner”.</p>
<p>I have two part time employees and a handful of contractors. I feel like the titles of CEO or President while I could use them truthfully - they wouldn’t be accurate or reflect the perception I’d like to show.</p>
<p>I’m sure I’ll change it at some point.  But that’s where I am today.</p>

            <p>Founder. Because it sounds nice.</p>
<p>I suspect people appreciate getting an email from a person whose signature says “Founder”, too.</p>

            <p>If I tell other people I mostly discribe myself as founder or independent developer.</p>
<p>But if I answer support emails I tend to use “Head of Development” or something like this. Maybe it gives my answer a little more weight?</p>
