    <title>How to sell more software</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-to-sell-more-software/4093</link>
    <description>Hi,

I wrote the article I think may be useful for bootstrapped community: &quot;[10 ways to increase website conversion or how to sell more software](http://www.icondesignlab.com/en/10-ways-to-increase-site-conversion/)&quot;. Hope you like it.

The article is written on Russian initially and then translated to English. So I have question to native English speakers: how well it is translated? Is this enough level of language to post similar articles in our blog, or language sounds funny sometime and we need to do additional proofreading?</description>

            <p>Just a quick read of the opening paragraph and a few samples here and there.<br>
(This content is stuff I already know).<br>
It does <em>not</em> sound odd as if it were translated poorly.</p>
<p>Looks accurate. It’s a little bit “like an engineer” would say it. So it’s sort of factual and to-the-point, but doesn’t “flow” as well as really good writing. So it’s a fine translation.</p>
<p>BTW, if you’re going to translate, perhaps having an overview where you just give the bullet points, so the text doesn’t need to be a “nicely written narrative” it’s just a bunch of bullet points.</p>
