    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Max from Jitbit</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-max-from-jitbit/1839</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m Max, co-founder of [Jitbit][1]. Many of you know my partner @jitbit  – he told me about this place.  

My job is mostly working on this [helpdesk app][2]. I know quite a bit about metrics, a/b testing, analytics and other data-driven stuff. Although I don&#39;t consider myself an expert in those things. I write programs since 12 years old. I&#39;ve written 23085 responses to Jitbit&#39;s customer support tickets so far, so I know a thing or two about that too.

In my spare time I play guitar, read sci-fi books and ride on skate/snow-boards. I may regret saying this, but I like Star Wars prequels almost as much as the original trilogy.

Anyway, thanks for your time. Hope to become a part of this community.

            <p>Hi Max,</p>
<p>welcome to the forum.<br>
Don’t worry about your Star Wars preferences - at least it is not Star Trek <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Christoph</p>
