    <description>Heyo,

I&#39;m currently a full-time software engineer starting down the path of building something I think (hope!) other developers will think is useful.  Not ready to share too many details about what I&#39;m building, but it&#39;ll likely be a familiar space for many of you.

All this to say, I&#39;ll be digging through lots of good information contained in this forum, and may be soliciting free advice soon.
