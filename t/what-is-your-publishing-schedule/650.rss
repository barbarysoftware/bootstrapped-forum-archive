    <title>What is your publishing schedule?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/what-is-your-publishing-schedule/650</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking on how to best handle marketing for Proper (http://properapp.com). My current strategy involves four areas (+ 1 I&#39;m thinking about):

- Weekly Emails to Mailing List
- Daily Finds (try to post interesting stuff to Twitter/Facebook 2-3 times a day)
- Third-Party Blog Posts (I have a writer doing one post a week for me)
- Special topic blog posts (no real schedule here, just when an idea pops in)
- I&#39;d like to try: drip/mixpanel notifications

My question for everyone is when do you publish? My big concern is finding the balance between staying relevant in my audience&#39;s mind while avoiding being the obnoxious guy.

Do you worry about this? How do you manage your schedule?</description>

            <p>BTW I send out newsletters to my PerfectTablePlan customers about 6-10 times per year, when I have something to say (e.g. a new release). And I put links to these newsletters on G+, Facebook and RSS. That’s it. I really don’t think they want to be hearing from me every day. But maybe your market/customers are different?</p>

            <p>One thing you could do (if you’re not doing it already) is to use <a href="https://bufferapp.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Buffer</a> for posting to Facebook/Twitter.<br>
Then you can use <a href="https://followerwonk.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Followerwonk</a> to set the perfect times to tweet out your content.<br>
This is a very easy, one-time setup (for the publication schedule) and Buffer is pretty easy to use, because there are plugins for your Browser.</p>

            <p>I do not have a strict schedule - I do produce a lot less content that you apparently <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I started recently blogging <a href="https://www.wisecashhq.com/blog" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> (and there is the associated newsletter, which basically notifies the subscribers that there are new blog articles).</p>
<p>To stay relevant, I figured out that I would divide my posts in three main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>features and updates (not everyone is interested)</li>
<li>cash flow and mastering your finances (more people interested)</li>
<li>growing and building a saas - technical/growth articles (even more people interested)</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not worry too much about my schedule (anymore) - I do as I feel <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
