    <description># Welcome software bootstrappers!

This a place where people just getting into the software business can ask questions, share ideas, and meet like-minded individuals.

Swap stories and learn the latest techniques to help our businesses prosper.

Our forum members make and sell desktop apps, SaaS products, and mobile apps. Some of us sell to consumers (B2C) and some to businesses (B2B). What unifies us is that we do this as bootstrappers.

We hope you find this forum useful and informative through your own journey as a software bootstrapper.

## Getting started here

## What&#39;s a Bootstrapper?

A bootstrapper starts a business without external investment. They fund the development of their company through savings, small personal debt, or internal cash flow and are cautious with their expenses. Growth is modest and sustainable. A bootstrapped startup is the opposite of a  startup funded by venture capital.
