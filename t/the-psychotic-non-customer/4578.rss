    <title>The Psychotic Non-Customer</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/the-psychotic-non-customer/4578</link>
    <description>A little story for Sunday reading:

Someone recently used the 30-day trial period of my software. At the end of the trial period, he asked for another 3 month trial. We often give a second 30-day trial, but 3 months...please! I can&#39;t pay the rent if I don&#39;t charge for my software, so I politely decline his request.

The non-customer answers, &quot;then I&#39;ll have to report your bugs to online forums&quot; and starts putting a nasty comment on each of our YouTube videos.

File under &quot;things-you-don&#39;t-realise-you&#39;ll-have-to-deal-with-when-starting-a-software-company&quot;

My next product is aimed at business customers. Do those of you targeting business customers also have to deal with similar nonsense?</description>

            <p>I’d ignore it, aside from dealing with Shopify and keeping them happy. They at least now know there’s someone with an axe to grind, in case other similar reviews pop up.</p>
<p>If the person persists, contact their manager. Seems to work for a company, the management of which I imagine don’t want to be seen as petty.</p>

            <p>It seems to be a feature of app stores that companies can be held to ransom by a tiny minority of idiots who give 1 star reviews.  But anyone with any sense is going to give more weight to the many positive reviews.</p>
<p>Bad luck on getting the wrong side of a psycho with too much time on his hands. Hopefully he’ll soon lose interest and go and annoy someone else. I just hope it isn’t me!</p>

            <p>Thanks. But actually this guy has been editing his review multiple times now to stay on top of the new (all good) reviews that have been coming in. I have a call with Shopify about this issue later today.</p>

            <p>Agree with Andy - when I am looking at TripAdvisor / Amazon reviews etc if I DON’T see some Muppet ranting with a 1 * review I actually get suspicious that they are fake or curated.</p>
<p>One idea that may or may not work is when you get the spidy sense that they are going to be a PITA is to perhaps pick up the phone. You already invested quite a lot of time explaining things in the forum/email for him and whilst it goes against everything we want to do most people do behave very differently the more personal the communication is - in person &gt; phone &gt; email &gt; forum - all downhill!</p>

            <p>You can read the review here: <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/judgeme#reviews-heading" rel="nofollow noopener">https://apps.shopify.com/judgeme#reviews-heading</a></p>
<p>What it comes down to, our approach is a bit unique in that we make our app look super fast by storing the review HTML and initial CSS inside Shopify Metafields (= they become part of the theme) and then use our JS file, which we render from KeyCDN, to apply some custom settings and deal with review submission etc.</p>
<p>Using this setup we completely avoid making a database call for rendering reviews, which no competitor managed to do. Our JS file is 100% static, same for every shop.</p>
<p>But so yeah, if we’d go calling the database each page load and prepare the styled review widget in our backend server, we’d have less JS code. But we’d also have over 10 million database calls per month, and would be as slow as our competition who sometimes takes 2-3 seconds to load the reviews.</p>
<p>We explained our point of view before this guy even installed the app (he complained first over email) but he’s extremely focused on the JS file size.</p>

            <p>That’s just awful - what a piece of work and what a twisted sense of justice/vengeance.  I truly feel for you.</p>
<p>Can I ask for the sake of the conversation here what the basis was for his review and why he felt your app should be banned from Shopify?</p>
<p>I’m just completely stymied over the fact that someone would throw such a shit fit over adding 63K to their page size?</p>
<p>(That and that these people we’re talking about apparently have <strong>nothing</strong> better to do than to just pick on someone’s software product almost to the point of harassment without regard for how it affects peoples’ livelihoods.  But that’s more of an existential quandary, I suppose.)</p>

            <p>I feel your pain. But I think most people now know to ignore the top and bottom 10% of ratings. Certainly I do when I look at rating on places such as amazon and  tripadvisor. Some people won’t be happy whatever you do. I found my skin thickened up quite a bit during my first year running my own business!</p>

            <p>The lead delivered on his promise and installed my app just to leave a 1 star app review. He also contacted Shopify to get my app banned, just like the other 1-star reviewer I had back in August.</p>
<p>At least it’s a 1 star review, prefer it that way now. I have yet to receive a 2/3/4 star review. People either love us (138 5-star reviews) or hate us (2 1-star reviews).</p>
<p>Oh well, the record growth we were on this month will not continue now… hope the guy is happy.</p>

            <p>Ecommerce owners deal with a lot of stuff (sales tax, logistics, suppliers, B2C support, etc). They may perceive selling some code at a fixed monthly price as easy in comparison. Granted, a Saas is probably a better business, at least at scale.</p>

            <p>Yes, because whatever business value he could get from adding your app his website is so obviously and most certainly not worth that insane 63K (<strong><em>MINIFIED!!!</em></strong>) increase in page size, bandwidth, and DOM performance.</p>
<p>On a side note, I wonder if he has fever dreams about all of the inefficient WordPress sites basically running the internet today…</p>
<p>Or maybe it’s just that his side project is a browser extension that blocks any website larger than 64K in total size and your app would have put him over the top.</p>
<p>Seriously, wow.</p>

<p>Your app adds a 63kB MINIFIED javascript to the page. I am almost tempted to install it just to warn other users with a review.</p>

            <p>Just had one literally today:</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-customer-service-overpriced-and-doesnt-work/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-customer-service-overpriced-and-doesnt-work/</a></p>
<p>I just happened to check my email this morning and saw the email he had sent on Friday (I was out of office Friday).  I sent him a reply about the issue, letting him know I was on it.  Apparently I wasn’t quick enough on that and he posted a 1 star review on my WordPress plugin site.</p>
<p>I still spent most of today (Sunday) to get the issue resolved, regression tested, and deployed - as well as sending plenty of correspondence on the issue.</p>
<p>Chances are, he was never interested in actually becoming a paid customer either (whenever anyone gripes that you don’t offer a free tier, that’s usually not a leading conversion indicator).  But that didn’t stop him from torching my app on WordPress for all my otherwise would-be customers.</p>
<p>Welcome to Startup Land.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>  Outreach seems to be working.  He’s upped his review from a 1-star to a 3-star so far.</p>

            <p>Other reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They’re more aware of the value. Your app saves money or it makes money. If value &gt; cost, don’t sweat it. With B2C there’s less ability to measure value so they’re free to focus on the cost.  ("$5?! Are you nuts?! Your competitor is free!")</li>
<li>They have other things to do. A bored consumer at home has more free time to complain. A person at work is in the mode of taking issues in their stride and employing their time in a generally efficient way given their task load.</li>
<li>Generally, B2B has no kids so you don’t get hormonal schoolchildren who love the feeling that they’re an adult on the internet.</li>
</ul>

            <p>I think the reason is that B2B are not spending their own money and thus not emotional involved in the purchase.</p>

            <p>Recently instituted a migration route from my old 1.0 system to the new<br>
version, with the original pricing preserved. Everyone with an active<br>
account at the time was invited.</p>
<p>I got an email a few weeks back from someone who said he was a “longtime<br>
subscriber” asking why he couldn’t migrate. It turned out that he had an<br>
account for a year, and then canceled long before the 2.0 migration.</p>
<p>I explained this to him, and he got angry, explaining again how he was a<br>
"longtime user" but he had just “paused” his subscription for several<br>
months. (There was no pause on the old system. There was only cancellation.)</p>
<p>In any sufficiently large group of users, there is always that one person.</p>

            <p>I am curious – could you determine whether he was actually using your software or was he a “stagnant prospect”.</p>
<p>Trial periods and demonstrations create a paradox for developers and small business.  We thirst of the sale but are simultaneously consumed by experiences like yours.   Clear boundaries up front are the key.  If you are in beta and need the continued feedback though a reduced price versus free is better.</p>
<p>Why?  No matter how much we need our beta testers and early adopters we need the customer to have SKIN IN THE GAME.  Without that they have no pain and there is no consequence to their failure to continue to invest time and effort.</p>
<p>B2B is somewhat similar, or can be.  In either environment you cannot give away services, those services have no value.  Be confident and put your value first. That confidence in your value will undermine customer’s like the one you just encountered.</p>
