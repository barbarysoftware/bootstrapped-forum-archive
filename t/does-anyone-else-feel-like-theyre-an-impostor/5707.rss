    <title>Does anyone else feel like they&#39;re an impostor?</title>

    <description>**_You&#39;re an impostor._**

You had a good idea one day. Your good idea turned into a great product. Slowly but surely, you gained customers who paid for your product. Then you started employing people. People who looked up to you, trusted you, followed you. You&#39;re successful - both the business and you personally.

And yet, there&#39;s still that little voice in your head...

**_You&#39;re an impostor. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing. Everyone&#39;s going to realise you have no idea what you&#39;re doing and it&#39;s all going to fall apart._**

Someone I admire a lot recently said to me, &quot;I have great respect for what you have done as an entrepreneur&quot;. I winced. And felt slightly less of him. How could someone that smart not see through me?

**Jason Cohen** (Founder, WPEngine &amp; Smart Bear) is familiar with these thoughts. Hell, everyone is familiar with these thoughts. If Mike Myers thinks he&#39;s not funny enough for SNL, then Lord help the rest of us. It&#39;s not an unusual feeling but when you&#39;ve founded, built and sold four successful companies and your latest creation has reached $100 million revenue and just received a $250 million private equity investment, you might be considered a &#39;success&#39;. So why do founders like this still often feel like impostors?

We&#39;re hosting a Q&amp;A session with Jason at 12.00 EST on 22nd February about overcoming impostor syndrome and founder doubt. Hopefully it&#39;ll be helpful - even if you can&#39;t join live, sign up and we&#39;ll send you the replay.

            <p>I embrace it nowadays: I know that I’m far from being a top developer, my sense of markets is quite poor, I struggle with many basic processes required for scalable business (hiring and managing other people? oh no!), etc.</p>
<p>So I’m not trying to be clever in any field. I write dumb code, use boring tech stacks, search for proven ideas where I can do better than competitors without relying on others too much. Another example: I write in a simple style for our blog because I’m not a native speaker but people say it’s nice and easy to read.</p>

            <p>If you feel like an imposter then just take a look at politicians. They clearly have no idea what they are doing (in my country, at least), and they are running the country!</p>

            <p>Never compare your insides to everyone else’s outsides.</p>
<p>Not to minimize the effect of it, but , I think a big part of Imposter Syndrome is buying into the story that things are (inside) the way they look outside.<br>
I can remember somehow wandering in the back rooms of some department store or electronics store and thinking “this is so… unprofessional”.  It wasn’t. It just didn’t <em>look professional</em></p>

            <p>Aha, that’s definitely my experience so far! Doesn’t mean it’s not good to talk about it though - especially in the context of running a business where it can feel like so much is depending on you.</p>
