    <title>Lifetime License Desktop Software - Customer asks for new Key due to System Crash after Years</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/lifetime-license-desktop-software-customer-asks-for-new-key-due-to-system-crash-after-years/6960</link>
    <description>Hello,
I sell a $30-$50 desktop software that requires only one time payment and offers lifetime license to the customer.Some customers after 2 or 3 years, contacts me to inform that their machine was replaced or OS was changed and asks for a new key for free.
My licensing mechanism is online and a single key can only be used once.

Should i give the customer a new key for free? 
Please advice</description>

<p>I would. That’s what they offered when Ethan bought 7 years ago, and since they’re still in business, they should honour their deal (ie.grandfathering). Hopefully they don’t offer that deal to customers these days.</p>

            <p>Not a lawyer, sorry. Also, not sure what’s the difference between free updates and maintenance releases, that wording is strange. Them offering maintenance releases for life was stupid, as technology changes and it may be impossible to support all these old versions.<br>
That said, it’s been 7 years. Do you really expect them to help you out forever? You may try to pressure them (I don’t think I would).<br>
In my business, we have upgraded the encryption on our server and very old versions can no longer activate. I have no intention of downgrading security on our server as old protocols are no longer secure. Also, it’s impossible to recompile old versions with new protocols as the product is complex. I instruct occasional users with the problem to upgrade to the latest version (and pay for it).</p>
<p>Do what you feel is right.</p>

            <p>My business bought Salon Iris software to manage appointments and client info and after a windows update, the software wants me to re-activate. But I can’t. I called them. they said they no longer support this version and I have to buy new subscription. And they don’t offer lifetime version any more.<br>
We paid $899 in 2013, the receipt said “FREEUPDATES Free updates for one year and unlimited maintenance releases for life” and “FREEEMAIL Free e-mail, webinars, &amp; web-based technical support for life”<br>
How can I get them to re-activate my software? my client info is important.<br>
Can I take legal action?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.<br>
Ethan</p>

<p>How to prevent customers from reusing the license on multiple machines?</p>

</aside>
<p>In most cases, this is a non-existent problem, most people just use the software on their own machine(s). You seem to be protectingagainst the case when Google buys one license and installs it on a gazillion of their computers?<br>
A possible solution is to limit the number of key usages for a certain period, for example.</p>

<p>In LimeLM? You deactivate the same key (click “Deactivate”, or <a href="https://wyday.com/limelm/help/api/limelm.pkey.deactivate/">automate it using the web API</a> – whichever you prefer), and the customer can activate on their new computer.</p>
<p>If this customer is lying to you, they won’t be able to use your software on the original computer after a handful of days (because your app, using our licensing, would “check in” every once in a while to see if the key has been deactivated).</p>
<p>This is all <a href="https://wyday.com/limelm/help/using-turboactivate/">covered extensively in our documentation</a>, and it’s as simple as calling a function (TA_IsGenuineEx). The function handles all the details and edge-cases.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I give everyone 3 active activations. This means they can activate on up to 3 machines. If someone gave me money, I trust them to use it for themselves only. The license is per seat, so it should be a single user operating my software on these 3 machines. Are people abusing that? Certainly. I don’t care. If people are abusing the licensing, they wouldn’t pay for another license anyway and I don’t like to be a police to my users.<br>
So, if their machine crashes, they can log into my website, deactivate the machine they no longer use and free up one activation.<br>
The longer you sell your lifetime licenses, the more people you have who will ask you for the help in the future. They may be great users, but that will be drain on your resources.<br>
I suggest to simply sunset the version you have now on the next significant rewrite and offer a separate SKU for the new version. Your old users still get to use the version they purchased forever, as well as install it when it crashes. They just don’t get to ask you things to fix or help in 2035, as is happening to me. Business changes. The most expensive version I used to have back then is now 10x less money than the current most expensive version - and there a no more lifetime licenses.<br>
Also, I am introducing maintenance subscription (30% of the list price per year). If they cancel the maintenance, they keep the version they originally bought but lose technical support and upgrades when the maintenance expires.<br>
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>I believe lifetime license usually means never expires, free upgrades. Whereas perpetual license usually means never expires, paid upgrades. Hopefully which one of these it is is very clear on your purchase page.</p>

            <p>Let me tell you that a lifetime license, especially for under $50 (but also for $1000) is a <em>very</em> bad idea. I sold some lifetime licenses long ago. Fast forward 15 years and those guys still contact me about all kinds of things. In the meantime my basic version’s price became 2x of the ancient lifetime version’s price.<br>
Yes, you can automatize license download (I have) and you can lock it to machine (I made my licensing that way). You can’t possibly automatize your time when asked for this and that 10 or 15 years later.<br>
Get rid of lifetime licensing and introduce perpetual use license with a 12-month maintenance included. Then, they can upgrade (you should automate that) and get the support only for the actual version.</p>

            <p>This is a solved problem. Namely, <a href="https://wyday.com/limelm/help/licensing-types/#hardware-locked">hardware-locked licensing (a.k.a. node-locked licensing)</a>. There are a small handful of good companies that make this (we’re one of them).</p>
<p>And yes, good licensing can handle simple cases like re-installing the OS, changing components like RAM, harddrives, etc., and see it as the same computer.</p>
<p>So, having a strict and accurate licensing solution doesn’t mean having a licensing solution that annoys customers. We’ve been doing it for nearly a decade and a half, so we’ve had quite a bit of experience solving this problems in non-annoying ways.</p>

<p>You offer lifetime licenses, so why ask this question? Make your licensing system work automatically so your customers can get keys by themselves, with their email as proof of purchase for example.</p>

            <p>That depends.</p>
<p>If you assume that most of your customers are felons who only look for ways to cheat you for a key, then it is prudent to refuse to provide a key.</p>
<p>If you assume that most of your customers are good people who crash or replace their computers regularly and fail to keep the original key, then it is natural to give them the key.</p>
<p>P.S. I heard there is an reverse dependency too - once you start to assume your customers are good people, your customer base indeed begin to shift to the good side.</p>

            <p>IMHO your licensing system is too strict.<br>
It is normal for users to change their PC or reinstall Windows.<br>
I would be angry if I had to purchase already purchased software again.</p>

            <p>Hello,<br>
I sell a $30-$50 desktop software that requires only one time payment and offers lifetime license to the customer.Some customers after 2 or 3 years, contacts me to inform that their machine was replaced or OS was changed and asks for a new key for free.<br>
My licensing mechanism is online and a single key can only be used once.</p>
<p>Should i give the customer a new key for free?<br>
Please advice</p>
