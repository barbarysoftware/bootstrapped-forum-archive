            <p>Re: MyKanban.</p>
<p>I believe that Kanban board has very little sense for a personal use unless you make the lanes customizable and boards shareable.</p>
<p>In the classical Kanban the “In Progress” lane is for others (not you) to see what tasks are already taken.</p>
<p>In personal Kanban you already know what tasks you have started doing, so what’s the point in that lane?</p>
<p>But if you get rid of it, it would be just another TODO list, with a very fancy way to draw a checkbox.</p>
<p>It can be saved to some extent by making the lanes configurable, but even then the main function of Kanban - simple coordination within a team - is simply not there.</p>
<p>So I believe to make this application useful you need to make the boards shareable. (Not sure maybe you did, I was listening while driving, and had to get distract to participate in the road rage from time to time).</p>
