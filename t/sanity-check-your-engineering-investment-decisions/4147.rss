    <description>Hey everyone, been posting to the odd thread here :)

I just made http://EngineerWorth.com, it&#39;s meant to help you decide whether you&#39;re using your engineering time wisely. CTOs / hiring managers / engineers would find it most useful.

It&#39;d also be helpful in doing price anchoring if 1) you&#39;ve made a product that saves eng time 2) or if you&#39;re doing engineering consulting and want to contrast yourself vs in-house engineers.

The overall idea of the site is that people end up visiting my consulting service, http://EngineerOverflow.com, and then inquire about working with me :)

Feedback is welcome!

Best,
David Trejo

            <p>Garrison, awesome!!<br>
So happy that it worked <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’m thinking I will swap the UI for range inputs, pretty sure that would be more intuitive.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback!<br>

<p>PS Good luck with your app per month project! I think the biggest challenge is probably finding expensive problems, and the people who will pay for them (and then selling to them). It’s totally doable tho</p>

            <p>So I want to say I did exactly what you wanted me to do… I went to the EngineerWorth site without even reading your whole post yet and then went to EngineerOverflow. So definitely does that!</p>
<p>The UI for the calculator was a little confusing, but I also figured it out and did exactly what you wanted me to do… So take that for whatever it means. Best of luck!</p>

            <p>Hey Ryan, thanks for the feedback.</p>
<p>It’s easier to work with bootstrapped and profitable companies because they usually have workplaces which are more attractive to engineers. So yes, the approach I take when sending them engineers is different. For a VC backed company, I would need to first convince myself of the viability of their sales/marketing team (the part that is most likely to fail, resulting in broken dreams).</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
D</p>

            <p>Interesting metrics.</p>
<p>Just wondering why you’re targeting “Bootstrapped and Profitable” businesses with your hiring service? Does VC backed mean a totally different approach for you and candidates?</p>
