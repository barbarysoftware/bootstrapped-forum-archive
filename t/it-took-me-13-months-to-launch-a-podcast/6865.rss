    <title>It took me 13 months to launch a podcast</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/it-took-me-13-months-to-launch-a-podcast/6865</link>
    <description>Yep, 13 months.

I run a site called [Failory](https://www.failory.com), where I weekly interview failed startup founders (and more). In February 2019, I had the idea of turning these written interviews into a podcast and so I started looking for a host.

Lots of things happened over the following months so it was September and I hadn&#39;t moved in any direction. Since then, me, Brandon (the host) and Joshua (our editor) have been producing, interviewing and editing until today, when we can finally say [we have launched](http://failory.com/podcast).

I believe that the longer you work on a project, the more difficult it becomes to launch it.

At first, I wanted to build something super quick, 20 minutes calls, without any structure and even almost no edition. The final products are 40 minutes interviews, with a deep-researched script behind, big names interviewed, a professional editor who has mastered the audio quality, etc.

It might seem as it was worth it, but... what if all this doesn&#39;t work? It would have been better to launch with something simple and validate the idea, right? In fact, there haven&#39;t been many downloads for now...

Let me know what you think. If you have any comments to share about the podcast, I&#39;d also really appreciate them ;)</description>

            <p>Sorry to hear that! And yeah, it seems like many people struggle to work and launch their podcasts. I think they call it “podstuck”.</p>

            <p>After reading your experience, even I can relate to it, I started a podcast last August and it took me 2 months to bring my first guest. The response was pretty great, I topped the Indian Charts but after that I couldn’t find the right guests, I got rejected by 70+ guests because the podcast was too young.<br>
But kudos to your effort!<br>
Best of Luck!</p>
