    <title>Alternative to Confluence?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/alternative-to-confluence/4777</link>
    <description>My company of three people uses Confluence as a wiki. We&#39;re using the cloud version, hosted by Atlassian. Confluence was great in the day, and is cheap and powerful, but I do find it slow and cumbersome.

Can you recommend an alternative company wiki that is also cloud-based? Speed, price, and good search are important to me.</description>

            <p>It’s not strictly a Wiki, but we certainly use it in such a way. We use <a href="http://www.quip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.quip.com</a> for all our shared documentation within the team and it’s fast, beautiful, and free. It’s made by a couple of people who worked on Google Docs.</p>
<p>It’s now a Salesforce product, though. But that also means that it should stay around.</p>

            <p>Cloud-based but cheap will always be slow. You’d be squeezed together with hundreds of similar low-tier users, fighting with them for resources.</p>
<p>Just two days ago I too have had enough with cloud Confluence+JIRA, and installed Redmine from a DigitalOcean image - $5/mo, bugtracker+wiki, unlimited users, fast. Took me 15 minutes to spin up the image and update DNS.</p>
<p>Then it took me 2 hours to migrate all the milestones, defects and issues to Redmine. Confluence migration is still pending, but I only have a few documents there, so it won’t take long.</p>

            <p>We use <a href="http://www.mkdocs.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mkdocs.org/</a></p>
<p>It is not cloud-based, just a static site generator from the md (Git markdown) files, so there are extra steps.</p>
<p>Fully customizable, great built-in search and (obviously) extremely fast.</p>
<p>We push changes by single click from the Jenkins.</p>
<p>Probably not for everyone, but worth a look.</p>
