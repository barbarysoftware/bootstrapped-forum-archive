    <description>Hey guys, 

This is Dipankar, ( http://desinerd.com and well, http://dipankar.name) have been building things/products for quite sometime but never really got down to building solo stuff (and consequently monetizing it). Hope to breakthrough this limitation! I have done quite a bit of consulting to help other build things as well, but don&#39;t find that to be sustainable by design.

Hope to learn from the experiences of others and help whoever i can!</description>
