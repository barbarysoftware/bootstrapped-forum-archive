    <title>Cheers from Tanzania</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/cheers-from-tanzania/6766</link>
    <description>Hi there.

My name is Abraham and I just discovered this site only a few minutes. I am a big proponent of bootstrapping so having a community built around it this topic just blew my mind. I just had to become a member. Looking forward to learning as much from you all as possible.

I am currently running a couple of side projects which for all intents and purposes are still in the validation phase. My most promising one to date has been a knowledge management app called Maarfapad dot com. Being from a medical and academic background, I am a tad bit obsessed about productive knowledge creation and usage. If any of you are into that, feel free to drag me in.

I look forward to having a blast with you all. Ahsanteni sana as we say here in Tanzania.</description>
