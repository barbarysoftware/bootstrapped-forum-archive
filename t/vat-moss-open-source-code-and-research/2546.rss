    <title>VAT MOSS: Open Source Code and Research</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/vat-moss-open-source-code-and-research/2546</link>
    <description>After doing a bunch of research about VAT MOSS and working on it for my own company, I figured I&#39;d share my code and research so others can opt-out of the SaaS solutions if they so wish.

The open source code provides tools for collection place of supply proof, calculating the correct VAT rate to charge, validating VAT IDs and generating invoices.

 - Python library: https://github.com/wbond/vat_moss-python
 - JS library: https://github.com/wbond/vat-moss.js

I&#39;ve also written a fair bit about VAT MOSS, including details about place of supply, invoices, registration, exchange rates and returns, plus my current approach to compliance. I&#39;ve included links to the sources I&#39;ve used, trying to stick more with government agencies than sites like VAT Live.

 - [VAT MOSS Overview](https://github.com/wbond/vat_moss-python/blob/master/overview.md)
 - [Implementation Approach](https://github.com/wbond/vat_moss-python/blob/master/approach.md)

I hope this proves helpful to others, and am grateful for feedback or suggestions.</description>
