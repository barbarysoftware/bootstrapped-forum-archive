    <title>Video interviews</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/video-interviews/1647</link>
    <description>I&#39;m thinking of doing video interviews for an upcoming book (the way Nathan Barry does), and was wondering, how does one go about it?

First, the script. Do you discuss the script beforehand? Do you tell the person what questions you are going to ask?

And second, the technical part. I tried to do a video interview using Skype and a free plugin, but it balked on me and refused to record. I was forced to take notes by hand. What tools/setup have you used for this?</description>
