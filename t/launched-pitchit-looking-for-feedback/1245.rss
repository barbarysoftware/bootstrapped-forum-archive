    <title>Launched PitchIt. Looking for feedback</title>

PitchIt allows you to present your slides to anyone, any time on any device.  There are no plugins to install, it works in a browser and on all devices.

I personally find talking or presenting on a topic is much less intimidating when I have visuals to reference.  As a result its usually a better for the other person(s) in the conversation as well.  You know what they say, a picture is worth a 1000 words!

Interestingly enough this was built out of an internal tool we used to Pitch our previous product :-)

What do you think it?

Thanks!</description>

            <p>Good news <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Thanks !  Let me know if you have any questions or feedback when you use it.</p>
<p>We initially used Vimeo but couldn’t get the quality to be sufficient.  Vimeo support said it was our video card… even though we tried it on 5 computers all with different versions of windows and video cards ?!?<br>
Anyway… so we uploaded the exact same video to youtube and it was much better.</p>

            <p>Cool. I’m definitely going to give this a try during some upcoming calls.</p>
<p>Regarding the video, you might want to use Wistia instead: gets rid of the pesky problems of Youtube which include the terrible final screen after the video ends which points to other youtube videos: <a href="http://wistia.com/pricing" rel="nofollow noopener">http://wistia.com/pricing</a> You can also use it to collect emails right in the video.</p>

            <p>I right-clicked to open in a new tab for some reason. Presumably most of your users won’t do that.</p>

            <p>Great feedback thanks.</p>
<p>RE: the play button.  Its supposed to open an Magnific Popup and play the video without leaving the page.  Did you access it via mobile or a smaller screen ? (I think under 700px it goes to youtube.)</p>

            <p>Following Andy’s comment, I think your banner image is “wrong” if there is such a thing. It immediately felt weird to me. All those strong lines in the architecture add a lot of clutter but the image mostly just shows a huge empty hall. Also the blueish/greenish tint feels off.</p>
<p>I think your other images are really good. They have impact and meaning which is what you want if you are to keep eyeballs on the page.</p>
<p>Also, your “play” button in the banner takes your hard-earned visitor to YouTube. I think that’s risky. Once you’re on YouTube you start watching other vids, and then … what was I doing again? You might never see them again.</p>
<p>The idea itself sounds interesting. Good luck!</p>

            <p>2 second impression of website - The font and layout of the website looks clean and modern. But the images don’t seem to match, They seem quite ‘noisy’ and cluttered.</p>
<p>I’m no web design expert though, so take that with a pinch of salt.</p>
