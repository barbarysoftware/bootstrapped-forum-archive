    <title>On Bootstrapping Planio to $75k/month in recurring revenue</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/on-bootstrapping-planio-to-75k-month-in-recurring-revenue/4572</link>
    <description>Our CEO at [Planio](https://plan.io) was interviewed on Indiehackers.com about maintaining a strong product vision, experimenting with pricing, and bootstrapping Planio to $75,000/mo in revenue.

I thought you might find it interesting because Jan talks about how we automate a lot of the business, shows the exact revenue growth since 2011 and how Planio got its first customers.

I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>Trust me, I could write a separate article about trademark issues I’ve either had myself or that I’ve witnessed very closely. If you don’t own the trademark you’ll end up having to change your name – that’s my experience, in Germany at least.</p>

            <p>I’m always amazed at how reasonably priced lawyers are in Germany. And I think the result of this is that it’s pretty cost effective to sue in Germany, so enforcement is much higher than in Ireland, for example.</p>

            <p>A good read. I like the growth curve: linear, not exponential, and extremely consistent. That’s a sane way to grow the business, and exactly how I want things to go with my new product.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Therefore, my advice is to register a national trademark”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I lived in Germany when I started Poker Copilot. Almost every German I told about my product asked me, “have you registered the trademark?” Outside of Germany, no-one has ever asked me that…</p>
