    <title>#136: Website security for bootstrappers</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/136-website-security-for-bootstrappers/6946</link>
    <description>Security audits! Bug bounty programs! Frequent unsolicited pen-testing! When you put a website on the Internet, it almost immediately faces non-stop security attacks.

Ed and I discuss the ways we handle this within the resources available to us as bootstrappers.

            <p>This episode was right on time.  With one app we just entered a formal, third party run bug bounty program.  Before we did that we hired security researchers to do a review.  As it’s in a specialized technical niche, we needed qualified researchers to do that.  Surprisingly, the security review was in the hundreds of USD only, and helped a lot in shoring up security.<br>
The idea about the responsible disclosure policy is good to know.</p>
