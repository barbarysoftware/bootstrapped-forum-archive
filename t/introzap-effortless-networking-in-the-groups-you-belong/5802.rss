    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/introzap-effortless-networking-in-the-groups-you-belong/5802</link>
    <description>We all belong to different groups/platforms from our college alumni group, to Facebook secret groups, whether they are online or offline for the major purpose of networking with likeminds.

However most of us don&#39;t benefits from these network either because they are too large or we don&#39;t just know where to start from. 

Introzap helps people within a group who have mutual interest and offerings to network effortlessly by sending one email introduction per day to each of them.  

To get started, we have created a producthunt Introzap account - https://producthunt.introzap.com/

How it Works;

1. Signup with your LinkedIn account 

2. Select what services you need, and what service your offering in return (Maximum of 3 each). Complete your profile

3. Receive your first email introduction, and reply that email to begin a conversation.
