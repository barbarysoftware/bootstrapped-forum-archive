    <title>Anyone Using SquareSpace + Stripe?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/anyone-using-squarespace-stripe/782</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve just setup a test web site on SquareSpace and I&#39;m really impressed with the whole infrastructure. Easier than Wordpress or coding PHP -- leaving me with more time for working on my app. 

I&#39;ve also connected their **[Stripe Commerce][1]** option and that was also quite easy. In the past, I have use FastSpring and Paypal for payment &amp; they work well too but I find the SquareSpace/Stripe integration quite elegant, seamless &amp; quick to setup.

In the end, I will probably offer all 3 types of payments if only to cover the regions of the world not covered by Stripe.

Anyone else selling software with SquareSpace/Stripe? What&#39;s your experience?
