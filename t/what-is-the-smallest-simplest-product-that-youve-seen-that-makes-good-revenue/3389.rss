    <title>What is the smallest/simplest product that you&#39;ve seen that makes good revenue?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/what-is-the-smallest-simplest-product-that-youve-seen-that-makes-good-revenue/3389</link>
    <description>When I first heard of bingo card creator from Patrick Mckenzie, I was so surprised at the simplicity of the product. I thought people paid money only for complex business applications (after all, on the internet everyone expects things to be free).

Do you have any examples of simple/small products that generate revenue (yours or others&#39;)?</description>

            <p>Yeah I met a guy who still maintains that website within Monkey Inferno and he told me what it currently makes, it’s still doing well. Great, simple and valuable idea…</p>

            <p>wow, <em>that much</em> money from a birthday greetings site, incredible!</p>

            <p>I think it’s grown now but I believe that at one point <a href="http://birthdayalarm.com" rel="nofollow noopener">birthdayalarm.com</a> was a simple service to get reminders about friends’ birthdays. Did it make money? Absolutely - this is from an article in the Guardian “… in 2003, Birchhad breakthrough with a greeting card site called <a href="http://birthdayalarm.com" rel="nofollow noopener">birthdayalarm.com</a>, and the money starting rolling in. “Birthday Alarm did work and became popular in 2003, and we were taking £10,000 a month, so it was very exciting. Then it went to £10,000 a day and we thought: ‘This is great’. Then we made £300,000 in a month, so that was the biggest turning point for us, by far,” says Birch”</p>
