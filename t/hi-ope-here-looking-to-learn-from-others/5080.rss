    <description>I am a full stack developer working on a couple of personal projects. One of them is thefeed.press, a tool that curates articles from your Twitter timeline and lets you easily follow them. I&#39;m here to learn from others bootstrapping, processes and entrepreneurship  among other things.</description>

<p>I mean how do you show the news stories? The stripped down layout?<br>

            <p>Thanks so much <a class="mention" href="/u/brian_o_neill">@Brian_O_Neill</a></p>
<p>“Your personal news page generated by links shared by your Twitter friends” really sounds better. I will also look at the speed issues. Onboarding is really important. By the way, I didn’t get what you mean by “Have you to parse the linked pages?”</p>

<p>Hi Ope, welcome to the site <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I tried your site. A few suggestions.  On the homepage you need to explain what the product actually does. Maybe something like 'Your personal news page generated by links shared by your Twitter friends.</p>
<p>When it is scanning feeds the process is quite slow. I would make it more obvious that something is happening. I know there is a progress bar at the top of the page but the effect is very subtle. A few times i thought the page had stalled.</p>
<p>Its cool that you are getting the text from articles and displaying them in a cleaner format. Have you to parse the linked pages?</p>
<p>The service reminds me a little of RSS feed services that were popular a few years ago. Just not sure how you would market it. A big issue is speed. The site was slow to load and scan the feeds, users are very impatient.</p>
