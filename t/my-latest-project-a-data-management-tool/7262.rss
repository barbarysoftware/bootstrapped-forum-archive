    <title>My latest project - a data management tool</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/my-latest-project-a-data-management-tool/7262</link>
    <description>Hello all,

It&#39;s been a couple of years since I&#39;ve posted here.  I&#39;ve had a number of failed attempts at starting a software business, and eventually took a break from that idea after actually finding a well-paying software job that wasn&#39;t horrible (on the bright side, my last project, though it failed utterly as a business, played a part in helping me get my current job).

Well, the lockdown happened, I got bored with all the extra time, and started on an open source project at least partially inspired by problems I&#39;d faced at work over the last several years:

[OpenDMP](https://github.com/rhinoman/odmp)

It&#39;s a platform meant to serve as a foundation for a (small) organization&#39;s data management needs.

Screenshot!:

I&#39;ve been trying to push the thought that this could grow into a business (i.e., open-core, services, etc.) to the back of my mind (to not get ahead of myself) until I can see if it catches on or not.  It&#39;s fairly early in development, needs more documentation, etc., but I&#39;d appreciate any feedback and/or advice - esp. on the how to promote an open source project front :)

Thanks!</description>

            <p>I think you should niche down. You’re basically building a form of a programming tool to which the answer to “can it do X” is always “yes”. That might sound like a good thing but in reality it means you have no idea how to spend your meagre financial and time budgets.</p>
<p>I used to work at a VC backed startup in a tangentially related space (we had a broader computing platform with a workflow style tool).</p>

            <p>I’ve spent 6 years developing and marketing an open-source ETL framework and low-cost desktop data integration tool, similar to yours. During these years I’ve made exactly 30K on a few custom data integration projects. We have made 50K in our first year with Etlworks and are growing ~ x2.5 annually since then.</p>

            <p>For what it’s worth - don’t spend time building an open source product. This comes from someone who co-founded a company in this specific space and took it to 7-digits ARR in 4 years.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>It is a pretty crowded space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yea, lots of solutions out there, including some <em>really</em> expensive commercial ones.  A lot of them are focused on particular use cases or types of data too.  I don’t think anyone has cracked the “general purpose” platform yet.  I’m hoping going the open source route will help here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data scientists are pretty wedded to the tools they already use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definitely.  Personally I’m not a fan of Python, but it has become the standard language for doing data science, so you have to support it with any solution like this.  I added Clojure support for myself <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No kidding.  I’ve seen some <em>really</em> gnarly spreadsheets over the years.</p>

            <p>Sounds you are coming at a similar problem to my own <a href="https://www.easydatatransform.com">https://www.easydatatransform.com</a> product, from a different angle.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Thanks for the question!  When I was making this project, I was thinking more along the lines of a (greatly) simplified <a href="https://nifi.apache.org/">Apache Nifi</a>, rather than Airflow.  As in, it’s focused on ingesting, processing, cataloging, and storing/shipping data around, rather than managing/scheduling workflows.  Though, I admit some overlap with Airflow is here as well - the data flows are indeed DAGs, whereas Nifi is much more… free-form (I believe this to be a detriment for a lot of use cases - you can end up with absolutely insane, unmaintanable NiFi flows fairly easily).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Apache Nifi is a bit too much to ask your typical Data Scientist/Analysts to work with (most know how to write Python script (btw, I do plan to add R support to this as well), but are definitely not qualified to do what you’d call “real” programming).   I’m aiming for something simpler - i.e., a smaller shop that needs to move beyond jupyter notebooks and having data scattered around personal workstations, and need to operationalize some of the ingest, data prep/cleaning, and processing parts of their data pipeline.   Also, Nifi is great, but it’s age is starting to show - it’s clunky to try to horizontally scale and use in a containerized environment.</p>
<p>I’m also trying to keep it open and flexible, I’ve seen workflows where you have to have some human-in-the-loop steps (labeling, reviewing, et al), and I aim to put that capability (to integrate with external tools) in here as well.</p>
<p>It’s still early, and a lot of stuff is missing, but I hope it’s far enough along to give folks the general concept.</p>
<p>P.S. Obviously, if you’re a big organization, you probably have the time/inclination/resources to come up with a bespoke solution perfectly suited to your needs, in which case this probably isn’t for you <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
