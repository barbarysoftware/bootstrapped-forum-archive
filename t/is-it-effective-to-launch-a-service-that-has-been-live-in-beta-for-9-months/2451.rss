    <title>Is it effective to LAUNCH a service that has been live (in beta for 9 months)</title>

I&#39;m a big fan of getting feedback rather than the &quot;stealth launch&quot;.
So our new speech therapy web app has been live for 9 months.  We&#39;ve advetised in Adwords for 6 months. (We thought we were 2 weeks from &quot;pay version&quot; for 3 months. I guess we were using Jeff Atwood (Stackoverflow) scheduling.

So I&quot;m thinking now that maybe we need to have an actual launch with a bit of PR around an &quot;event&quot; rather than quietly &quot;turning on the &quot;pay&quot; switch.

Any thoughts pro or con?

            <p>Yep, that’s kinda how I thought The Launch would work.</p>
<p>Since our service technically launched 9 months ago, not sure if we have an “event” to build around.<br>
(Other than “we are now charging for it”. NOT the event that would appeal to them <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"><br>

<p>I’m the last person to ask about launches, but…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The launch is announced to some auditory. Do you have a mailing list, professional forums or some other place where the prospects are concentrated and can be reached?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The launch, I believe, follows some period of building up a desire to buy, a “OMG it’s gonna be sooooo good” kind of feeling. Then launch releases that feeling and channels it into the action (of buying). It doesn’t seem you have built that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also believe the Big Launch works better for some ground-breaking projects. Adding a new media (web app) doesn’t seem like a launch-worthy event… though of course it may be, for instance, if it allows for radically new features.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I.e. if I were you, I’d channel my efforts into focused marketing to the potential users – patients, their relatives and the speech therapists. LinkedIn? Facebook? Anything that allows for better targeting than blind Google adwords.</p>
