    <title>Hello, I&#39;m Glenn from Caffeinated Tech</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hello-im-glenn-from-caffeinated-tech/167</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve already read through several of the posts here and have already learnt a few things!

A few years ago, I already tried setting up a consulting business with the aim to transition into products as income increased. Alas, it didn&#39;t work for various reasons, a number of which were out of my control but forced me to take a *day-job* again to get back on my feet. I now refer to these experiences as **business school**! ;-)

I am now getting back into development and preparing to start bootstrapping again while keeping my current dayjob. I have been feeling motivated by listening to both the Bootstrapped podcast and [Quit!][1]
