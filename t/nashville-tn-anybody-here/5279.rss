    <title>Nashville, TN: Anybody here?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/nashville-tn-anybody-here/5279</link>
    <description>I moved to Nashville from Los Angeles last Summer and I haven&#39;t found many actual bootstrappers here.

If you&#39;re currently bootstrapping, and you are in Nashville, and you are interested in meeting in person from time to time please let me know!

Thanks, Oliver</description>
