    <title>Introducing Cohorts.co - One-click retention analysis for your Stripe account</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/introducing-cohorts-co-one-click-retention-analysis-for-your-stripe-account/2767</link>
    <description>I&#39;d love to get everyone&#39;s feedback on cohorts.co

How many of you guys use cohort analysis to get a better idea of how your customers are canceling over time? I&#39;ve spent a lot of time trying to do cohort calculations in the past so I made an attempt to automate it. 

I just launched it last week and I&#39;ve been talking to prospective customers to see what kind of needs they have. I&#39;ve had a couple of people sign up which I&#39;ve gotten some great feedback from but I&#39;d like to hear from you guys and get your thoughts. 

Thanks!</description>

            <p>Thought about you with the launch of Cohorts in Google Analytics… How do you see yourself differentiating?</p>

            <p>Gotcha.  In that case I love it on all counts.  Get something out the door without being bogged down by figuring out the exact pricing (or feature set) up front.  You have a great initial feature and price point for starters and can develop it out from here as you go.</p>
<p>Good stuff!  I actually changed/increased my pricing three times since I started, and surprisingly pretty much all of my customers were totally fine with it.  If you have a good relationship with them and communicate the reasons behind it, and the reasons make sense, and it’s still a good investment for them, then I think they’ll understand.</p>
<p>Or even easier you just create new tiers with new features that they’d have to upgrade for.</p>

            <p>Thanks! helpful feedback. You’re right, I’ve been playing around with the pricing so that’s been a work in progress. I will probably move towards a tiered pricing model at some point but I felt like I should keep it simple in the beginning so that I didn’t spend too much time on it pre-launch.</p>
<p>You’re also right about the feature vs. product. I’ve had a couple customers sign up so I’ve been talking with them to figure out what other tools would be useful to them. I’ve got a few ideas I’m throwing around.</p>

            <p>I like it. I can definitely see this as being an easy &amp; cost efficient alternative to sites like MixPanel &amp; KissMetrics as it relates to the Cohort side of things. Similar to the thought <a class="mention" href="/u/kalenjordan">@kalenjordan</a> pointed out - I’m interested in your long term play. Great work - The landing page is to the point and clearly communicates the value. As a marketer by trade, this is something that I could definitely see value in and consider using…</p>

            <p>First off, great domain!  And beautiful landing page. The value prop also seems really clear and straightforward.</p>
<p>I wonder if you might be able to increase your pricing and/or tier it out a little bit.</p>
<p>Also wondering what your long term play is here. Seems like ultimately most analytics apps are about helping businesses understand how to grow with a variety of tools / metrics at their disposal.</p>
<p>Cohorts feel maybe like more of a feature than a product. Although a very interesting feature for sure.</p>
