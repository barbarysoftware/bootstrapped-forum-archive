    <description>Hey folks, trying out a new hiring strategy. In an effort to convince &quot;A players&quot; (a term I&#39;ve just learned from the excellent book &quot;Who: The A Method for Hiring&quot;) to quit their current full-time jobs and join me, I&#39;ve written a blog post describing why it&#39;s likely hard to start a product business at their current full-time job and why taking a full-time job with me is a much better path. Basically I&#39;m trying to appeal to talented developers who also have ambitions to start their own product business.

[Give it a read][1] and let me know what you think. I&#39;m very interested to get feedback from you folks about this strategy as I&#39;m sure many of you have also faced the challenge of finding and hiring A players.

            <p>Very well written! Seems like a great plan to me. I’m more of a business person ie. I develop ideas, not code. So I’m happy to provide feedback on that front, but I’m useless to you as a programmer.</p>
<p>PS - Loved Halifax. Drop me a line if you get out to BC.</p>

            <p>Brad - I think you’re providing a great opportunity for someone with development chops, who’s interested in learning the ropes of business &amp; product development.  It’s hard to overstate the value of having good mentors.  A job that gives you a little extra time in your week, pays a reasonable wage, and immerses you in a learning environment on a weekly basis sounds just about perfect.</p>

            <p>As a dev who works a full-time corporate job and tries (not successfully enough) to peddle his software of the side, I would say I’m intrigued.</p>
<p>If I was younger and didn’t have a family to support, I would apply just to see how it would go. I think the only question for me would have been would I be too gone each day deving on your products to want to then spend hours more deving on mine. Of course, that’s what I do now - so maybe not…</p>
<p>You also didn’t specify what part-time means. You might also want to spin it into a way for them to keep their current fulltime job while they feel your side out.</p>
<p>P.S. Your choice of Lego graphic is spot on.</p>
