    <title>Where to find outsourced 24/7 technical help &amp; support?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/where-to-find-outsourced-24-7-technical-help-support/3028</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

Basically I want to build a service like http://getmagicnow.com/.

I need real-time humans to chat with a client, help them with whatever they need.

In my case it&#39;s pretty limited to my own software. Basically I want a team of support overseas who can chat with client and use my software to help the customer. The customer doesn&#39;t see my software ever, they just receive the results.

What do you think, and can you think of specific websites that I can outsource this too? I&#39;m thinking Philippines because they speak English.

I asked taskus.com and it costs $18,000. I don&#39;t have a budget that big, my budget is probably 10 times less than that at the moment.

Please help!</description>
