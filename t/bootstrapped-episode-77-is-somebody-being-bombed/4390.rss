            <p>I didn’t really understand what your guest did until I listened to the podcast. Once I understood, he turned out to have some very interesting things to say. If you have him for a repeat appearance, I’d probably have some questions…</p>
<p>I don’t recall what he said were the three (?) things he does to an app he acquires to improve profitability: was it fix up support, fix up first time experience, and something else?</p>

            <p>The number of followup (asking for more details) questions was small. As the result, the level of details was low, too. Or, rather, some of the details (e.g. criteria for buying an app, scaling up an app) were spread across the whole episode.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe I was just interested in some things, and the hosts in others.</p>

            <p>Great episode with someone who has a very smart mixed business model.</p>
<p>I did find him much harder to hear than the two hosts; perhaps do like some podcasts and have a mic you can mail to guests to try to ensure clear audio?</p>
