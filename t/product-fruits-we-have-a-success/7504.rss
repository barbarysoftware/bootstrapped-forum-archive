    <title>Product Fruits - We have a success!</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/product-fruits-we-have-a-success/7504</link>
    <description>Hi all!

I&#39;m proud to say that Product Fruits really nailed it. It looks we are adressing the problem which most SAAS has today - we focus on increasing conversions from free trial users to paying customers in the app.

Today a common problem is, that 80% of the users (or even more), that try an app for the first time, won’t end up converting to paying customers, which is totally crazy.

Let me know if you want to know more about Productfruits (can&#39;t insert the link as I&#39;m newbie)
