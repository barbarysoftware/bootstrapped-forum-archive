    <title>Ian&#39;s new email list and ebook</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/ians-new-email-list-and-ebook/591</link>
    <description>Hey all,

This forum has been such a blast that I&#39;ve decided to take on another new adventure in bootstrapping with an email list. I&#39;m hoping to get it out weekly-ish and cover all kinds of different things that I&#39;ve learned starting UserScape.

It&#39;ll also provide a place where I can expand on topics we talk about here as well as introduce new topics that can overflow to the boards.

Along with it, I&#39;m giving away a new ebook created by Chase Clemons and myself on customer support for bootstrappers. Hopefully you find that useful as well, I&#39;d love to hear what you think.

            <p>Thanks! Chase did all the heavy lifting, he’s the real guru but I played my small part.</p>
<p>I’m most worried about finding time to write each week, but hopefully I can make it happen. I’ve gone too long without writing regularly anyway. I think the more intimate setting of an email works better for me than blogging at this point.</p>
<p>Yeah, really wish I was there.</p>

            <p>This is a straight gangster move.  eBooks are “the thing” right now.  I love it.  Just retweeted it.</p>
<p>…are you and I the only ones here who aren’t in Prague right now?  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
