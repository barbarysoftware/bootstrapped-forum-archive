    <description>[NC Professor turns hobby into weather website][1]

&#39;What was a part-time hobby became a professional business. With a home office, his daughter handling bookkeeping and his wife selling advertising, the computer scientist turned into a weather entrepreneur. His staff has grown to nine paid employees, including a team of four meteorologists.

&#39;&quot;We started with zero investment and literally pulled it up by the bootstraps,&quot; he said.&#39;


----------

Interesting business, and one which could be replicated in other locations.

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/steve">@steve</a> Great story! Sounds like Ray Russell is passionate about meteorology &amp; would have done it for free – in fact he did at the beginning.</p>
<p>His success would be hard to replicate without the passion tho. Looks like someone would have to work years installing weather stations &amp; building a reputation before getting any real profit.</p>
<p>What is replicable is finding something you’re passionate about &amp; doing it selflessly as a service without thinking of making it into a business. This way, it will be a personal success, no matter what – profits or not. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
