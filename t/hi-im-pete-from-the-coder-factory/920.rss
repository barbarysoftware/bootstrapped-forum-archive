    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Pete from The Coder Factory</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-pete-from-the-coder-factory/920</link>
    <description>I recently started a coding school in Sydney, Australia. My students are all entrepreneurial and looking to create their own tech startup companies and want to learn to code.

I&#39;m loving my new business and career and have a lot of big plans for this coming year. I&#39;ve just started blogging too so looking forward to getting better at writing. My Latest post is &quot;[Taking coding mainstream in 2014][1]&quot;

I also run [The Startup Community][2] site which is about to see a big overhaul. It is currently just focused on Sydney but I want to take it global :smile: 

I&#39;ve heard great things about this community so really excited to be a part of it. Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions about Sydney or The Coder Factory.

Pete
