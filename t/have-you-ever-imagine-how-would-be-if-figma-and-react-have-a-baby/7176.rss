    <title>Have you ever imagine how would be if Figma and React have a baby?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/have-you-ever-imagine-how-would-be-if-figma-and-react-have-a-baby/7176</link>
    <description>We are working on an open-source FrontEnd framework called [Scalab](https://scalab.app/), which combines visual and programmatic workflows, allowing designers and developers work together, and we believe it looks like the kid of Figma and React.

Please check it, tell us what you think, and give us your comments and feedback.
