    <title>Save money on Intercom, Mixpanel, etc?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/save-money-on-intercom-mixpanel-etc/4247</link>
    <description>At my company we occasionally have to trim back the number of users in Intercom/Mixpanel/etc so that our bill doesn&#39;t grow completely out of hand.

Does anyone else here find themselves doing that?  I&#39;m thinking about building an app to do this automatically and am trying to find out if others are experiencing that pain.</description>
