    <title>Patio11&#39;s 10 Years in SaaS talk from LTV Conf 2016</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/patio11s-10-years-in-saas-talk-from-ltv-conf-2016/4636</link>
    <description>Until 1st January 2017 you can get free access to Patrick Mckenzie&#39;s session from Life. Time. Value. Conference 2016. You&#39;ll be able to watch the video, download the audio and slides and/or read the transcript:

http://sessions.ltvconf.com/p/2016-patrick-mckenzie/?product_id=177051&amp;coupon_code=XMAS2016

Disclaimer: This is from the conference I ran in July in Brighton, England. (The next one is on the 19th April 2017). **And I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll need to create an account with an email address to get free access**. But once you&#39;ve registered you&#39;ll have access to this session forever.

The week between Christmas and New Year has loads less work distractions than the rest of the year. If you&#39;re considering using that time to bootstrap something I strongly recommend you take 30 minutes to watch Patrick&#39;s talk first. Amongst other things he covers:

SaaS
* His darkest hour running a SaaS business.
* Why you shouldn’t run a software company as your first business.
* Why being a SaaS entrepreneur is like being a cardiologist.

Products
* What you really need to make $10K/month.
* The saddest story from conferences he’s attended.
* How to decide on the price for your first product.

e-books
* How to price books for professionals.
* The four things that work for everyone selling B2B e-books.
* What’s your repeatable sales strategy?

Productised consulting
* How to sell your services as a product.
* Three good options for productised consulting.
* What to do when a potential client says you’re too expensive.

Avoiding a traditional Job
* How to get closer and closer to a business that achieves your goals and fits your values.
* The glide path to doing a SaaS from being a consultant.
* Why you don’t have to share Silicon Valley’s perspective on what success means.</description>
