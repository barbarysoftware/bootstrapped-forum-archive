    <title>Is anyone up for a bootstrapped business accountability group?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/is-anyone-up-for-a-bootstrapped-business-accountability-group/5288</link>
    <description>Hey all, I&#39;m a small business owner and I was thinking of a way to hold myself accountable and be more productive. The idea is to form a group and help each other out with different tasks for our respective projects. 

To keep interest and hold people accountable we pay an entry fee and everyone that carries out a certain number of tasks shares the pot at the end of the month. These tasks will be things like feedback, reviews, beta testers, social media interactions, backlinks or whatever you can think of. 

Anyone interested in something like this?</description>
