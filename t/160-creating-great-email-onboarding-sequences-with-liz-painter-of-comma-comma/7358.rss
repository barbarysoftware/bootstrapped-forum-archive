    <description>Liz is an expert in onboarding email sequences. Over the course of this episode, Liz helps me design a great email sequence for Saber Feedback.

On the way, there are plenty of practical tips for better emails that you can apply to your product&#39;s emails.

            <p>You should listen to this episode, but if you haven’t the time or desire, here’s some tips Liz gave me. These tips are all specifically for <a href="https://saberfeedback.com/">Saber Feedback</a>. YMMV.</p>
<ul>
<li>When a customer signs up for our 10-day trial, send them 1 email a day for the first five days, then a trial expiry reminder at day 8 and day 10.</li>
<li>Each email should make one point and have a clear action that we ask the recipient to make</li>
<li>Address common sales blockers in an email.</li>
<li>One email should be a customer testimonial.</li>
<li>There should be a gradual arc through the emails, but each should stand alone</li>
<li>Use a plain text format, because for B2B that’s more likely to be read than “designed” emails - unless you are Canva, or another product that is about design.</li>
<li>No emojis in B2B email sequences</li>
<li>Keep it reasonably informal: open with "Hi ", and end with “Cheers, Steve” or “Thanks, Steve”. Not “Regards”</li>
<li>Send from a real person’s address, and not “support@” or “no-reply@”.</li>
<li>Sender name should be “Steve at Saber Feedback”. Make it personal.</li>
<li>Sending on weekends is okay because many people check their email ALL THE TIME regardless of day of the week</li>
<li>The day 10 “your trial is over” email should offer a 2- or 3-day trial extension.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The big, big tip is to do customer research first</strong>. Talk to customers, find out how they would describe your product, what concerns they had, etc. This gives you the language and concepts for your emails.</p>

<p>That’s really interesting to hear. I’ll consider doing something similar if I start to hear that the short trial is a problem, especially with larger customers.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/stevemcleod">@SteveMcLeod</a> I found the trial length discussion quite interesting.  For a couple of years I ran a NPS feedback SaaS, and trial length was a crucial factor for larger clients.<br>
For the biggest client it went usually like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>CEO/CCO:  We need a new website with NPS/feedback</li>
<li>Website manager outsources/delegates this to web dev</li>
<li>web dev starts implementing, looks for feedback service</li>
<li>web dev puts js snippet in dev site and needs a service that works for dev for multiple months, the web dev has no authority to pay, they can just use a free trial.  However they need to demo the new site in the coming months.</li>
<li>6 months later the new site goes online, and now they are ready to buy</li>
</ul>
<p>We solved this by having free plan with strict limits, which allowed development usage.  And we were very liberal with plan upgrades for people who were devs/had staging sites.</p>
