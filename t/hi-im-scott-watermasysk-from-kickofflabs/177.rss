    <description>Hi Everyone, 

I am Scott Watermasysk, the smarter, better looking, and more humble co-founder of [KickoffLabs][1]. 

KickoffLabs provides an easy to use platform for email marketing, lead generation, and landing page management all backed by exceptional support (seriously, we love support!). 

We are profitable 100% bootstrapped company and have been in business for about 2.5 years.

One of the reasons we originally build KickoffLabs was to help other would-be entrepreneurs realize their own dreams of starting a business and building something they could love, so if there is anything I can do to help you be successful in your own business, please do not hesitate to ask here or email me directly at scott@kickofflabs.com
