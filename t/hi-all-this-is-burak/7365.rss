    <title>Hi all, this is Burak</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-all-this-is-burak/7365</link>
    <description>Hello everyone!

This is Burak. I am originally from Turkey, and currently living in Berlin. I have studied Computer Science in Istanbul Technical University, and I am currently working as a software engineer at Hellofresh. I am 25 years old, and have been working in the industry since I was 19.

I love building things, and I like challenges; combined these two, it was almost impossible to not get into indie hacking I guess. My latest adventure is Nana, a SaaS starter kit that is focused on getting started with SaaS products super quickly.

I am excited to be a part of the Bootstrapped community, have a nice week!</description>
