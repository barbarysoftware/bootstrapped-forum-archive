    <title>Hi, I am Simon from HarleyPro</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-i-am-simon-from-harleypro/1297</link>
    <description>I run my own agency - mostly managing, designing and developing cloud software, websites, apps and digital products direct for clients. ***But...***

I am currently bootstrapping [www.harleypro.co.uk][1] - a cloud-based private medical practice management system for practices in the UK. Got my first client signed up, a Harley Street Practice in London, and hope to start piloting it in the spring. Marketing website will go live in the summer, once I am happy with the pilot, so ignore the landing page!

Sold a sports website in 2000, that I ran and grew in my spare time, started when I was still a student.

I also own [www.remindeo.com][2] - a reminder service which I just built as a learning experience a few years ago for fun, which got &#39;accidentally&#39; popular! So planning a relaunch for the second half of 2014. I bootstrap Remindeo as well.

I live in Aldershot in the UK (about 35 miles outside London), with my lovely wife Renata.

I love movies and tennis (watching and playing badly!).

Looking forward to getting to know some of you on this forum! 

Been listening to the podcast for ages, so not sure why it took me so long to get on this forum!

            <p>Hi Dave - Silicon Hampshire, I think we could be onto something!</p>
<p>I see you did some work for Balsamiq. I interviewed Peldi @ Balsamiq for a blog ages ago when there was just two of them at the company I think. Such a nice guy.</p>

<p>I do A/B testing via campaigns of different offerings designs etc once a product is live, but I love chatting to potential customers to validate ideas. They tell you great ‘stories’ which always lead to killer features. I suspect I am “preaching to the converted already” by saying that though?</p>

<p>My pilot site/client has made some introductions. I was introduced to him via a mutual friend. Also, I have been running my own agency full time, sub-contracting for other agencies and running business networking events for about 12 years. Before that, I was running a website and doing some freelance stuff in my spare time for about 5 years.</p>
<p>So, just using lots of contacts in my existing network.</p>
<p>No cold calling or selling, just introductions.</p>
<p>Old School! ;0)</p>
<p>I think the fact I haven’t launched yet means I am not considered a “salesmen” yet, which maybe helps a little too, but not much.</p>

<p>How are you actually getting a foot through the door? I imagine private practices are very busy, and very wary of salesmen?</p>

            <p>Hi Andy - thanks for getting in touch. I heard your interview on the podcast a while back, so knew you were in the UK.</p>
<p>Name - possibly. It’s a valid point.</p>
<p>I think some outside of Harley Street will aspire to it, some maybe put off by it.</p>
<p>Also… does it sound like a Harley Davidson pro racing team!?</p>
<p>The problem I have had with the name is finding something available. Often you have drug companies and health manufacturers with product names pre-dating the Internet which rules out hundreds of names, plus the more usual naming challenges with other online medical businesses, trademarks, cyber squatters and apps etc.</p>
<p>I thought about using some kind of “non-name”, a made up word, but the practices I have been speaking to during the development can be quite conservative (really interesting mix actually - very friendly, a little conservative but very entrepreneurial). I think HarleyPro sounds quite “dependable” for them, which I like.</p>
<p>I do own <a href="http://patientgo.com" rel="nofollow noopener">patientgo.com</a> / <a href="http://co.uk" rel="nofollow noopener">co.uk</a>, which is more fun and dynamic sounding, but maybe a bit too “light weight”?</p>
<p>Good luck with your new product launch.</p>

            <p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>Do you think having “harley” in the name will put off private medical practices not in Harley Street?</p>
<p>I’m also in the UK (Swindon).</p>
