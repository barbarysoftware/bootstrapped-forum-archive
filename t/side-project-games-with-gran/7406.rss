    <description>Side Project : Games with Gran

I&#39;ve built a side project - **[Games With Gran](https://www.gameswithgran.com/)**.

&quot;Classic games like Tic Tac Toe &amp; Four in a Row and Checkers with built in super simple and secure video conferencing to help keep your family in touch.&quot;

https://www.gameswithgran.com/

The idea was born in Covid Lockdowns to try and help my Grandparents keep in touch with my young kids using simple games.

As with all the best side projects I&#39;ve given ZERO thought in how to market this or monitize this (though thats not a priority to be fair, should be very modest cost to run).

Hopefully some of you may find it useful.

Any ideas especially on Marketing / Monitizing?</description>

            <p>Some ideas on the monetization</p>
<p>Adverts - don’t want to go this route as it destroys the usability when gran or kid gets trigger happy and ends up somewhere they didn’t want to be.</p>
<p>Payment / Sub - could do, maybe easier as an App (iOS/Andorid) as all the payment infrastructure already setup.</p>
<p>Mobile App - should be easyish to adapt using something like IONIC but then not sure how would deal with people using PC’s. Looks like a lot of faff putting things in multiple app stores (never done it though).</p>
