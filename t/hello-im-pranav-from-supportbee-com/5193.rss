    <title>Hello, I&#39;m Pranav from SupportBee.com</title>

    <description>Hello everyone, I&#39;m Pranav.

I have been working with SaaS businesses for a couple of years now, first as a developer and lately as a product designer/manager - being closely involved with product and business strategy/planning.

I&#39;ve recently started a solo side-project, which I&#39;d soon like to share it with the bootstrapped community. I&#39;m working on getting a landing page ready to show some product mockups, and get some early validation.

I hope to be an active member of the community.

Cheers!</description>
