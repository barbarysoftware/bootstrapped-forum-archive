    <title>Promoting educational apps</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/promoting-educational-apps/5998</link>
    <description>I made a Spanish-learning app that feels like a nice fit for the hundreds of &quot;Resources&quot; pages made by teachers for their courses in schools and colleges. It&#39;s free for 10% of content and offers a Pro version for a few dollars.

Has anyone tried contacting teachers? Are they generally ok with cold emails? What are their expectations?

Any other ideas on promoting to teachers and educational institutions?</description>

            <p>It’s basically a bit sophisticated flashcards app, so it works best on mobile. Subscription model wouldn’t work because the app barely needs any updates.</p>
<p>Here’s the email pitch, it got me 3-4 backlinks and one teacher’s reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Hi _, / Dear Ms. _: ]</p>
<p>I found your page of [recommended student / Spanish learning] resources and thought you might find this interesting.</p>
<p>I’ve been learning Spanish for a while but couldn’t find an easy-to-use conjugation app, so I built one myself: <a href="https://qotoqot.com/conjugato/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://qotoqot.com/conjugato/</a></p>
<p>It contains 1,000 of the most popular verbs, with a conjugation table for each. The first 100 verbs and two tenses are free, and upgrading to the pro version costs only $4.</p>
<p>It would be great if you could add ConjuGato to your page. I can also send you a promo code for the pro version – please let me know if you are using iOS or Android.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time!</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>Pretty interesting, lot’s of great insight there, thanks for that!</p>
<p>I’m curious, why did you go the mobile app route? I’d have assumed that you’d be able to charge more with any of the other delivery modes; saas or native desktop as opposed to in-app purchases but then for this type of app I guess it makes more sense.</p>
<p>Also, how did you pitch to these sites to get the backlinks? cold email, free licenses?</p>

            <p>Only one teacher replied after sending almost a hundred pitches, so I’ll skip this kind of outreach next time. But the app got a few backlinks from the old-school sites that list resources for language learning.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m not doing anything special beyond ASO because mobile apps are 90% centered around the stores nowadays (Apple killed the App Store’s referral program this August and now app review sites are dying).</p>
<p>Google Play instantly put the app into top-5, thanks to their clever ranking that considers many factors, including backlinks and apps’ descriptions.</p>
<p>The App Store only looks at the keywords and installs, so the app initially ranked at <span class="hashtag">#60-70</span> positions there – below badly rated competitors and even irrelevant apps. So I’m now paying for the Search Ads in the App Store with the profits from Google Play to get more installs. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/face_with_monocle.png?v=6" title=":face_with_monocle:" class="emoji" alt=":face_with_monocle:"></p>
<p>I also did a big giveaway on a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/9spi9g/i_made_a_spanish_verb_conjugation_app_pro_version/" rel="nofollow noopener">Spanish-learning subreddit</a>: it brought a bit of revenue and some reviews (though it seems that the reviews from users who activated promo codes don’t count for ranking).</p>
<p>The app itself, ConjuGato:<br>
