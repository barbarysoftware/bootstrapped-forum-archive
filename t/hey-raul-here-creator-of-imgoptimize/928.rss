    <title>Hey, Raul here, creator of imgOptimize</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hey-raul-here-creator-of-imgoptimize/928</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been a developer for around 10 years. A few years ago, I started to get entrepreneurial with GDocsOpen (double click to open any office document in google docs). That didn&#39;t work out that well, I made the product free.

For almost a year, I am the proud owner of imgOptimize, a utility that shaves extra bytes in images, without affecting the image&#39;s quality.

Currently working on biz-eye.com, a notification system regarding different web metrics (like blacklists, page rank, and so on)</description>
