    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Jim from SoloPracticeManager.com</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-jim-from-solopracticemanager-com/943</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve started a SaaS app [SoloPracticeManager.com][1] for, oddly enough, managing a single-owner client-based business. Originally targeted to life coaches, I&#39;ve made it general enough for anyone who has clients/students: massage therapists, music teachers, etc.

It is currently ahead of the minimal viable product model and ready for work. I&#39;m trying to get enough users this winter to get into a full beta. I&#39;m offering an open 30-day free trial, but am doing manual billing until I can build the payment system.

Feel free to get in touch with me @jimfmunro or jim@jimfmunro.com

I look forward to more interfacing with this great community.  Thanks to Andrey and Ian for getting this together and providing a great podcast.
