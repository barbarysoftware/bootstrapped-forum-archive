    <description>Hey guys,

I have just launched a free Bootstrap theme specifically designed for Startups, small businesses &amp; SaaS applications called StartKit.

I thought some of you might find this useful for your startup website.

**Demo &amp; Details** - authenticpixels.com/product/startkit-responsive-startup-business-template
*(Sorry, can&#39;t post the link here because I am a new user. You&#39;ll have to copy paste this :( )*


StartKit is responsive, fully-AJAX (with smooth page transitions) and has 25+ pages - pretty much everything you need to launch your startup/product website.

You can use the free version for your personal/commercial projects without any attribution. If you want to customize this template, you can take a look at the Premium version ($15) which will give you access to the following - 

- Complete, well-organized &amp; modular SCSS code base
- Nunjucks based templating (no need to copy changes across multiple HTML files)
- Modern tooling &amp; workflow (automatically concatenate and minify CSS, JS, HTML + Live preview of your changes)
- Pre-built integrations with Ruby on Rails and Node.js

**Again, you do not need to pay for this at all if you don&#39;t need the above features. Go ahead, download it for free and use it in your projects!**


Let me know if you find it useful!</description>

            <p>Hmm, you are right, this does include a few plugins (lightbox, masonry, slick slider &amp; countUp). But removing those should not be very difficult. They are all included separately in the layout file and referenced once in the main.js file.</p>

            <p>I think it looks good. One big problem I have with a lot of these prebuilt templates is they look good but seem to include every jquery widget under the sun. To untangle the mess and make the template lighter is a pain.</p>
