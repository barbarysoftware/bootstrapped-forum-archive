    <title>What to change in my Pre-launch landing page?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/what-to-change-in-my-pre-launch-landing-page/2181</link>
    <description>Hey!

I&#39;ve been working for the past month or so on a new subscription box for software developers.

Before investing too much money into it, I developed a pre-launch page and I&#39;m planning to spend a couple hundred dollars on Reddit/Facebook ads and promote it manually to validate the idea.

Here&#39;s the landing page: https://www.devcrate.io

It&#39;s looks simple, but I&#39;ve put a lot of effort into the whole concept so far.

This is the first venture I actually pre-launch, so I could really use some insight and opinions on what to change and what to keep.</description>

            <p>The FAQ does answer the questions I had, but it’s hard to find.  I was thinking the “what’s in the box” info would be on the page somewhere.</p>

            <p>I’ve added a FAQ to answer the questions you guys had, can you confirm that you’d be more inclined to sign up now as opposed to without the FAQ?</p>

            <p>Without any hint as to what comes in the box, I think people will be uninterested and not sign up. There are plenty of similar subscription services and many (most?) have some kind of “here’s a typical box” thing showing what to expect.</p>

<p>It’s probably enough just to say some version of this on the page (probably low and small).  It would have answered the question I had.  I like the idea – good luck with it.</p>

            <p>Thanks! English is not my native language so stuff like that sometimes goes through, already changed it on the production site.</p>
<p>Regarding the example contents, I didn’t do it because I didn’t want people to assume that the contents of the box are fixed. The purpose of this box is to have a kind of “monthly Christmas”. You don’t know what’s inside until you open it.</p>
<p>I can, however, guarantee that the value of the box is a multiple of what you’re actually paying for it (a cool tshirt alone costs &gt;$20 on most retailers). I didn’t specify since most people told me to slim down my copy.</p>
<p>A couple people registered through Bootstrapped. If you guys have any suggestions regarding what should I ship on the box, feel free to reply. I’ll do my best to accomplish it.</p>

            <p>I’d want to know more specifically what I’d be getting in a box.  Does the $25 get me a shirt and a sticker?  Three shirts and five stickers?  An “example contents list” or something like that would help.  The background image does a good job of providing samples.  Looks good.  Also, I think "there is a limited amount"would sound better as “there are a limited number”.</p>
