    <title>MockLab: simulate the APIs your app depends on for earlier, better testing</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/mocklab-simulate-the-apis-your-app-depends-on-for-earlier-better-testing/5922</link>
    <description>Hi,

[MockLab](http://get.mocklab.io/?utm_source=discuss.bootstrapped.fm&amp;utm_medium=forum&amp;utm_campaign=show-bootstrapped) is a SaaS tool for mocking/simulating APIs, which I’ve been bootstrapping for the last couple of years.

Why would anyone want to mock an API?

A few reasons - often the API you’re building against isn’t ready yet, and you get stuck waiting for a release before you can properly test your app. Or it might not have a stable sandbox. If you’re using a 3rd party API it might cost you money every time you run your tests, and many companies flat out refuse to let you run performance tests against their APIs (including every payment provider except Stripe as far as I can tell).

Finally, mocking APIs allows you to test edge cases and failure modes the real system won’t produce on demand, but probably will in production come Black Friday.

Although MockLab launched about a year ago it’s been somewhat under the radar, with all leads so far coming from [wiremock.org](http://wiremock.org?utm_source=discuss.bootstrapped.fm&amp;utm_medium=forum&amp;utm_campaign=show-bootstrapped) (the OSS tool it’s based on). I’ve been trying to improve the website with a view to getting it in front of a wider audience, so I’d really appreciate any constructive feedback you can give on any part of the experience.

Many thanks,
Tom</description>

<p>That’s an amusing and very eye-opening way to look at that! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/laughing.png?v=5" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:"></p>
<p>Only the happy path is <em>probably</em> the same for all users of a service. And maybe the most common error scenarios.  All the project-specific scenarios (success or failure) you’d have to setup yourself.</p>
<p>But even a common happy path + common errors is a good starting point for a turn-key mock service.</p>

            <p>Indeed, you’ve hit the nail on the head there.</p>
<p>I’m probably going to give this a try shortly, starting with the Paypal API. Planning to test the water first with a tutorial blog post, and if that gets some interest build a Paypal API template that can be loaded when you create a new API. I’m hoping this will net me a few more performance tier customers.</p>

            <p>I quite like this idea, I had a similar one many years ago after getting frustrated at my day job when building out integrations.</p>
<p>The nice thing about this business is that it lends itself to partnership and integration marketing. You could have common “MockKits” for different products which are pre-built mocks for popular integration points.</p>

            <p>Starter is (by a small margin) most popular plan at the moment, so I guess somebody thinks it’s useful <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Some points about the Performance plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our customers use it to mock 3rd party APIs like payment gateways that aren’t on their network.</li>
<li>If you’re on AWS and want low network latency we’ll put the host in the same region as your systems.</li>

            <p>Benefits of it being hosted:</p>
<ol>
<li>You don’t have to do the following things yourself: building VM(s), deployment/upgrades, SSL certificate management, backups</li>
<li>Team collaboration</li>
<li>We keep it alive and healthy for you</li>
<li>Easier for us to support you</li>
</ol>
<p>Incidentally, it’s based on WireMock, which is an OSS library, and is therefore downloadable/installable yourself.</p>

            <p>Team work, most likely. Which makes the Starter package (1 user) useless (correction: less appealing).</p>
<p>I’m also not convinced the Performance plan (presumably aimed at performance/load testing) is useful. Systems installed inside corp network have 100Mbit and 1Gbit channels to them, making the response time very small. I’m not confident that can ever be achieved against a hosted mock backend.</p>
