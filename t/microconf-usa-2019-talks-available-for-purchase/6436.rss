    <title>MicroConf USA 2019 talks available for purchase</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/microconf-usa-2019-talks-available-for-purchase/6436</link>
    <description>MicroConf&#39;s 2017 videos are available to the public and 2018/2019 are for sale.

Get them here: https://www.microconf.com/growth/past-videos/ 

The 2019 talks are $99, the 2018 talks are $49, and the talks from 2017 are free.

This is great value for us bootstrappers, and well worth buying.

I believe if you went to the US conference this year, or are going to MicroConf Europe later this year, you can watch all these talks for free.

(I bought the 2019 package myself and am working my way through it.)</description>
