    <title>List of Resources to Help Build Your First Product</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/list-of-resources-to-help-build-your-first-product/5348</link>
    <description>Hi bootstrappers. Hope you&#39;re going well and all your analytics are moving up and to the right.

I&#39;ve put together this big list of resources that I wanted to put in front of your eyeballs for critical feedback:

[173+ Super-Duper Resources to Help Build Your First Product](https://yourfirstproduct.com/info/resources)


My plan is to use it as a piece of content marketing for the book i&#39;m putting together.

It has a little in common with a useful list @Andy Brice put out a while back (https://successfulsoftware.net/tools_and_services/) and a great post from @rachelandrew (https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2013/12/23/the-bootstrapped-product-resource-list/) (both of which get mentioned near the end in the &#39;meta&#39; section.)

Two questions for you:

1. What can be improved? Constructive criticism very welcome.

2. In your opinion, where in particular could I share this (other than right here of course)?</description>

            <p>Leon, awesome list, thanks!<br>
Would you mind adding gettemplate to the “Website Templates/Themes” section please.<br>
I’d also add scaleway to the “hosting” section. I’ve found it very useful: $3/mo for a dedicated ARM server (I like the idea of arm servers itself), or a x86 vps for the same amount of money.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I’d heard there was a way you could pseudonymously see user sessions in Google, but last time I checked they don’t like you doing anything that allows you to identify the person behind them.</p>
<p>Mixpanel shows you the actual user details (username, email and whatever else you give it) for a given event stream. We’ve found this really useful for identifying leads who are likely to convert or need a little help and sending them a timely message. We’ve also found it helps us get to know our leads/customers - much easier to build a picture of someone’s needs and behaviour when you’ve got a name, avatar, job title etc. rather than just an abstract identifier.</p>

            <p>Excellent Tom. All those features sound very useful. The limitations for free users aren’t too onerous, and there’s A/B testing features.</p>
<p>There <em>is</em> a feature in google analytics that lets you see an individual users visits over time, i think it’s fairly new (a year or two). It’s quite rudimentary, the user has a Client id and you can see when they come back and what they do.<br>

<p>I’ll look into Mixpanel some more though. Cheers.</p>

            <p>We’ve been using Mixpanel as our main analytics tool since we launched and have had a very positive experience with it.</p>
<p>It lets you identify individual users unlike GA, has much better funnel analysis and you can write custom queries in a Javascript DSL.</p>
<p>You can get quite a long way in it for free too. The main limitation we ended up paying to extend was the 60 days data retention window.</p>

            <p>I use GA but I did some searching for an alternative. Couldn’t find anything that I was willing to pay for at this point but I would really prefer not to keep enlarging the Google empire if possible.</p>
<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Netlify</a> for my static site which allows you to A/B test by using separate git branches. Only requirement is that your site is static, which I know might be a deal breaker for many, but their service is free for single users.</p>

            <p>Sorry, one bit I needed more help with:</p>
<p>Do you use anything for analytics other than google analytics?<br>
And do you do A/B testing, if so what tools do you use?</p>
<p>(I just use GA and don’t A/B test)</p>
