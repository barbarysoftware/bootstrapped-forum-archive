    <title>AMA Google Hangout - Claire Lew, Know Your Company</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/ama-google-hangout-claire-lew-know-your-company/3835</link>
    <description>Claire Lew, CEO of Know Your Company, did a great talk at BOS USA last year helping people to understand the reasons that CEOs and Managers are often the last people to know key things in their businesses. More importantly, she offered some great ideas about how to get the best out of the people you work with.

You can see the [video, transcript, attendees notes, the slides etc here](http://businessofsoftware.org/2016/02/dont-be-the-last-to-know-bos-usa-2015-know-your-company/)

Even better, we are running an online AMA Hangout with Claire on Wedesday - [join us and Claire](https://plus.google.com/u/1/+BusinessofSoftwareConference) if you want to ask her about getting the best from your team.</description>
