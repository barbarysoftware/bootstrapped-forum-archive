    <title>Hola! I&#39;m Mike - startup nomad</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hola-im-mike-startup-nomad/649</link>
    <description>I&#39;m Mike. I&#39;m Aries and love to take nice romantic walks in park...oh wait, it&#39;s not that kind of forum. doh!

For the last 20 years I&#39;ve been building lots of other peoples&#39; products and, in the last 10, helping them do good work with agile and lean approaches. I&#39;m bootstrapping my startups one at a time whilst I am in exile in Spain from the UK ( hey, it&#39;s a 40% lower cost of living!).

I&#39;m a solo founder and would love to meet other solo founders for fun and frolics. (Uh oh - that didn&#39;t sound right!).

Right now I&#39;m working to get traction with http://servicechatapp.com - a chat room that you get trigger from a tweet - to help businesses engage with customers on twitter (instead of divert them to some anger-inducing offline channel like the phone).

I&#39;m also exploring turning my process coaching work into a remote based, subscription model to help my existing customers access experience and expertise at a much less prohibitive cost. I&#39;m doing really to help them and me have more certainty.

As Margaret Wheatley says - Whatever the Question is, Community is the Answer. I hope to be an active member of this here community and if there is anything you feel I can contribute to - here is my open invitation!

Welcome to me.</description>

            <p>Thanks fellas. It feels really cosy to be amongst people trying to do the same as me - build something of their dream.</p>
