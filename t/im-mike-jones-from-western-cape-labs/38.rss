    <title>I&#39;m Mike Jones from Western Cape Labs</title>

    <description>Howzit.

I&#39;m a serial failure having started and killed several businesses since my first back in &#39;97 (Clearly New Media, when media was new and CD-ROM&#39;s were going to rock).

I&#39;m currently running a small software business called [Western Cape Labs][1] in the most [instragram-able][2] city in the world, Cape Town, South Africa where I moved two and half years ago from London with my wife and three kids.

We run a niche eCommerce business called [On The Way][3] which runs on a platform I built and a consultancy that actually pays the bills. The consultancy mainly builds smart apps for dumb phones (think healthcare applications on a Nokia you had 10 years ago) and web applications.

All four of my previous businesses have been bootstrapped completely but Western Cape Labs was funded for it&#39;s first 9 months by some friends who believed in our crazy dream so I guess I&#39;ve now &quot;cheated&quot; but we&#39;re back to bootstrapping now! 

I&#39;m a huge believer in open sharing so really hoping this thing flies in a way that benefits those who take the time to stop by.

            <p>Hi, Mike. Good to see you here. I know it can take a lot of tries to succeed. I started and killed 5 businesses (or more like dumb business ideas) since 2007 before starting Snip in 2011, the first product business of mine that actually made any money.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/imsickofmaps">@imsickofmaps</a>, I know it’s a bit non-kosher for a bootstrapping forum, but I’d love to get some insight on how you got a little help from friends. I’m in the mix of having a lot of people that believe in my company, but don’t know how I can ask for help other than a few handshake leads…</p>

            <p>Hi Mike. Great to have you here!</p>
<p>I’m glad I’m not the only one on here who wrote software for phones back in the day before the new mobile app hotness.</p>
