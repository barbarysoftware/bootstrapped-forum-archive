    <title>Idea: Hourly Designers</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/idea-hourly-designers/2552</link>
    <description>As a engineer with little to none design experience, sometimes I have trouble defining the UX/UI of my web apps. I also regularly need someone to design me logos/banners/etc. and going through oDesk is usually a PITA. The site is slow, the portfolios are usually not relevant and the whole process is not optimised.

I had this idea where you could have a listing of designers that specialise in different categories (UX/UI/Logo design) and a link to their best behance/dribbble projects, along with their hourly rate.

As a client in need for a designer, you could easily access the website and browse through the different portfolios to match someone within your budget and with a design style you like.

What do you think? Is this different enough from oDesk/Freelancer to be worth someone&#39;s while?</description>
