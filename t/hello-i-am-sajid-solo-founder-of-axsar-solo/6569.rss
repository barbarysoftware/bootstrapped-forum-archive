    <description>Hello,

Nice to meet you all.

* I am Sajid, solo founder of AXSAR Solo
* AXSAR Solo is an all-in-one workspace for small teams. It allows them to run all aspects of their small business using a single SaaS solution. Managing clients, sales, service, invoices, files, activities, notes, files.
* In 2008, I built a classified platform in Finland for cars, jobs, and real estate. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t had proper experience in building it as a proper business and it result in 10,000 euros loss. Great lessons learned!
* In 2011, I developed an app that has been downloaded by over 4,000,000 users and has generated six figure $ revenues.
* In my day time, I work as a Solutions Architect in the e-commerce space.
* I have an MBA degree from Finland/US, and an MSc Software Engineering degree from Finland.
* Right now, I live in London.

Best regards,
Sajid
