    <title>Your questions for JD Graffam</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/your-questions-for-jd-graffam/4381</link>
    <description>If schedules work out, we&#39;ll have [JD Graffam](https://twitter.com/jdgraffam) as a guest on the show this week.

JD runs two agencies, SimpleFocus and ClearFunction, as well as several SaaS products, including Sifter, Pulse, Ballpark, and others.  

I&#39;m looking forward to our conversation with JD. Hopefully he&#39;ll tell us the secret of how he managed to grow all these businesses without resorting to sleep deprivation or cloning.

If anyone has any questions for JD, or would like us to visit specific topics, please leave a comment on this thread before Tuesday, September 20th.

Thanks!</description>

            <p>The world is unbalanced. How come this guy runs so many SaaS, while I cannot launch even one?</p>
