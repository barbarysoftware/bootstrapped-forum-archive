    <description>Hey everyone,

I&#39;m a french guy that for some weird reasons is now living in London. My day job involves doing marketing stuff on the interweb, also known as growth hacking (with air quotes) for [Pusher](http://pusher.com/). I&#39;m probably not the right profile for this forum, but here goes nothing.

You can actually read my full introduction in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/sylg/483c5d12a6fef250d4cb) because

            <p>Ah awesome! Always cool when you get that bidirectional customer relationship going. We have a ton of great stuff coming out over the next 6 months (much of it Pusher based!).</p>

            <p>HI all, glad you like my intro. I think I got carried away a little bit but that was fun!</p>
<p>Also, it always make me super happy to meet Pusherinos (as we like to call you around the office) in the wild. and <a class="mention" href="/u/ian">@ian</a>,   we are ditching Tenderapp this quarter and the finalists are Snappy and Zendesk. Personally, I was sold at the robot but the decision is not mine. Hopefully, we will start giving you some cold hard cash by the end of the year.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the forums Syl - I agree that is an impressive intro (the one in the gist).  Great to have someone with some marketing chops in the forum - that’s an area I am… let’s say working on improving <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
