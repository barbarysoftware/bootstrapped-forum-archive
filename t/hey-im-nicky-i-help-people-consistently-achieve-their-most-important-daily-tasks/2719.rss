    <title>Hey, I&#39;m Nicky - I help people consistently achieve their most important daily tasks</title>

    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m a developer boostrapping an OSX (desktop) app that helps you consistently achieve your most important tasks. It&#39;s called ActionAlly.

It did pretty well on Product Hunt here (http://www.producthunt.com/posts/actionally) and Hiten Shah published it in his newsletter after enjoying the experience.

That influx of traffic was great but I&#39;m a little bit stuck at the moment without a clear path for keeping the momentum moving forward.

I&#39;m here to learn and execute. Any thoughts or advice is much appreciated!</description>
