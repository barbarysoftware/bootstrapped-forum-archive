    <title>My first &quot;info product&quot; a course on getting started with Stripe</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/my-first-info-product-a-course-on-getting-started-with-stripe/1949</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, my day job as a teacher allows me to take on a side project during the summer months.  The last two summers I worked on my SAAS product [SubmitBox][1].  This summer I decided I want to create an online course.  After some back-and-forth, I decided on creating a course about using Stripe.  I use Stripe for SubmitBox&#39;s recurring billing, and I&#39;m a huge fan of what they&#39;re doing.  

Anyway, if you&#39;re interested in using Stripe with one of your projects, I&#39;ve created a 50% off coupon for members of this site.  Use the link below to get the discounted price.

            <p>Nice!  Sounds like a great company.  My app’s in beta right now, and fairly quiet.  I’m doing a lot of consulting work at the moment to pay down some debt, so I’m not actively pushing it or adding features.  I’ve gotten a good reception and a lot of useful feedback from my early users, so just using that to move it forward a little bit at a time.</p>

            <p>Hi Corey. I’ve enjoyed using Udemy so far. They have a pretty simple and clean UI for their backend and they even created a course image for me at no cost when the simple image I originally submitted didn’t meet their standards (graphic design isn’t one of my strong suits).</p>
<p>How is your app doing?  Are you getting sales?</p>

            <p>Nice work! SubmitBox looks really nice.  My app (<a href="http://jiffydecider.com" rel="nofollow noopener">JiffyDecider</a>) works in a similar problem space – organizing workflow around session submissions for conferences.  I also use Stripe for everything and love it.  How do you like udemy?</p>
