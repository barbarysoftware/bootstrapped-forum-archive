<p><a class="mention" href="/u/tomzur">@tomzur</a>, awesome article. I read it on Indie Hackers earlier this week and left with a plethora of new knowledge that I’m looking to apply to my own marketing efforts.</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/mgowski">@mgowski</a>,</p>
<p>Glad you liked the post and thank you for your feedback!<br>
I was emailing to relevant people. I always made sure to make my homework before approaching anyone, made some basic research, got familiar with his/her work, website etc. Bloggers regularly write about their problems or just tweet about them let’s say “My website is slow can someone help” or “I’m looking for a new WordPress host, suggestions…?” So there are lots of opportunities. Even if you just give them some tips or recommendations, or offer to try your service for free. In the very early days, this worked really great and I was able to make some really good connections. Later they became paying customers, affiliate partners or they simply recommend our service when someone needs their help. My advice is to be relevant and helpful.<br>
If you have a good service and you would like to find “easy” opportunities Twitter is an awesome place. You can find really high leads, automatically. My friend Primoz wrote a great article on the topic make sure you take a look:   - It’s a Medium post but it seems I can’t post it –<br>
Cheers, Tom</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/tomzur">@tomzur</a></p>
<p>Great article, I always like reading from folks who have done it!</p>
<p>Could you comment a bit more about “Email is free, don’t be afraid to use it” - before you reached your first 100 customers what were you emailing out to everyone? Were you asking them to try your service or was it something else? Also curious if this was in the scale of 10 contacts a week vs 100 contacts or 1000 contacts a week.</p>
