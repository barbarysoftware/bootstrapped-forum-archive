    <title>SHI - delayed paymenets?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/shi-delayed-paymenets/3805</link>
    <description>A fair number of corporate customers use SHI as a reseller to purchase my products.

They are normally a good prompt payer - but recently (last 3 months) they have been very late.

Anyone else seeing this?</description>
