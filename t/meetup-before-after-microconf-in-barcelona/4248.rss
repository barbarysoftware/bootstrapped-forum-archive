    <title>Meetup before/after Microconf in Barcelona</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/meetup-before-after-microconf-in-barcelona/4248</link>
    <description>Microconf is here in Barcelona in the next few days. I decided not to go to the conference this year, but as Barcelona is my adopted home city, I&#39;m happy to meetup with anyone from this forum who might be in Barcelona for Microconf.

Let me know if you are interested, and I can try to organise a time/day/place.</description>
