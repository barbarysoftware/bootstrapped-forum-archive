    <description>Hello Friends, A very happy new year to all. I found this site from Indiehacker.

We are Canada based startup. Looking for your valuable feedback on a newly developed website, https://closecook.com (Passionate Host cooks around you)

This website helps us to search and locate a home cooking personnel from the close-by neighbourhood, who can provide us with home-cooked food, of any kind of cuisine. The interested recipients who are into running a home cooking business can register and suggest the kind of cuisine they can offer. People can order home-cooked food or can host an online cooking session or share their own recipes through this website. It also holds an option to do a video chat while cooking or sharing a recipe. It is a very user-friendly website and can be highly beneficial for home-run businesses. I kindly request you to provide your feedback on concept and site design if possible. Thank you.</description>
