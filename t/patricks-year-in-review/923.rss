Our own @patio11 posted his year in review today. I think it&#39;s a really good read, especially if you&#39;re just starting out. There&#39;s a lot of real world examples of how even someone who&#39;s done this for years still has struggles. As always some great tips/ideas as well.</description>

<p>What You Can Learn 2014 has begun and like me, you’re probably looking for ways to improve. If you’re trying to build your business, grow your audience or just start earning revenue from a side-project, you’ve come to the right place....</p>

<p>I love the fact that we’re in a community where people are happy to be honest and open about their revenue numbers and their strategies. Someone just referred to this article as ‘crack for bootstrappers’!</p>
