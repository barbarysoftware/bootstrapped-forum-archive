    <description>Has anyone had a successful experience with retargeting for a B2B app?

Here is our experience:

Last year we kept hearing from different people how awesome retargeting is, so we decided to give it a try. We launched retargeting campaign for [Helpdesk][1] via http://perfectaudience.com/ (it was recommended to us). It is a B2B app, so we had some doubts about running ads on Facebook and Twitter, but we did it anyway.

Unsurprisingly, results sucked. Facebook was a little better than Twitter, but the conversions were too low on both services. CTR was okay – around 1-2%. We tried it with dedicated landing pages too – no improvement. It turned out to be around $500 for every paid customer we got. And we got just two or three. We shut down the campaign.

A couple of months ago a sales guy from http://www.adroll.com contacted me and offered to run a campaign. They have a huge ad network. We decided to give it a try again in hopes that web retargeting will perform better than FB/Twitter did. So far we&#39;ve been running a campaign for about three weeks and results are better indeed, but still not good enough.

            <p>Also keep in mind that PerfectAudience has a thing called a “view-through conversion”. What this means is a visitor was shown an add, didn’t click it, but later on the same day they went directly to your web site to convert. AdRoll has it too. Here is a quote from an email I got from them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… if we serve them an ad August 5th and they convert that same day, there is definitely a correlation between the ad served and the customer’s action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a correlation, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that their action was caused by seeing an ad.</p>
<p>Anyway, don’t forget to share the results of your test.</p>

            <p>I am currently trying retargeting with PerfectAudience. I am getting (rather expensive) additional clicks and some of these people buy. The question is - would they have purchased anyway? I’m currently running a test to try and find out. It might be a while before I have enough data to say.</p>

            <p>Retargeting works for my b2b saas. We only dabble in it for now, but it has definitely worked better than basic PPC.</p>
<p>But it’s all about how you use it. There are lots of ways to retarget. I find it works best when pointing users to opt in for free content (or free consultation), then use it again to move them along the sales funnel.</p>
