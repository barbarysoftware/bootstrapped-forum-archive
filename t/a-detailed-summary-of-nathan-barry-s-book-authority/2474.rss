    <title>A Detailed Summary of Nathan Barry’s Book: Authority</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/a-detailed-summary-of-nathan-barry-s-book-authority/2474</link>
    <description>Nathan Barry&#39;s book [Authority](http://nathanbarry.com/authority) has been the single most useful ebook I&#39;ve purchased. I&#39;m using it to write my own self-published book [Mastering HubSpot](http://robsobers.com/mastering-hubspot).

I&#39;ve read the book twice and the second time around I took really detailed notes. I put them together on my blog in case anyone wants a taste of what the book is about. 

I highlighted many of the main ideas, which can take you pretty far as a self-publisher, but the book itself has lots more detail and some excellent case studies.
