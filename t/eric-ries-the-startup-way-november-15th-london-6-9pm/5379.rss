    <description>Greetings Bootstrappers. In case you hadn&#39;t noticed, Eric Ries publishes the follow up to his hugely successful and influential book, The Lean Startup, this week. The Startup Way builds on his original idea and considers what has changed in the five years since the first book was published. HE also considers how Lean Startup methodologies apply to larger organisations.

We&#39;re running an evening event, talk plus Q&amp;A with Eric in London, 6-9pm on 15th November. Attendees will receive a free copy of Eric&#39;s new book as well as the opportunity to ask him your burning questions.
