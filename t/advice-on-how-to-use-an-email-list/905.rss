    <title>Advice on how to use an email list?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/advice-on-how-to-use-an-email-list/905</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve learned bits and pieces about email marketing over the last couple years and I now know juuuuust enough to be really confused. At this point in time I actually do have an idea of what I&#39;d like to do, but I need a little help sorting out the details.

Quick background:

 - I run Snip Salon Software, which is [scheduling software for hair salons][1].
 - I&#39;m not a domain expert in hairstyling.
 - I don&#39;t have an email list at all.

I of course want to have an email list. For a long time I couldn&#39;t think of anything of value I could email to a list of salon owners. I&#39;ve never run a salon or cut hair, and I don&#39;t think I have the resources to get a hairstyling/salon expert to write for me.

But lately I realized there IS something of value I could provide to salon owners: I can give advice on choosing salon software. For example, steer away from desktop-based salon software because you&#39;re going to have to pay for upgrades. Basically what I guess I&#39;m talking about is a [consumer awareness guide][2]. I know I could do a great job of that.

And I of course know that if you have something of value to provide to prospects, like a consumer awareness guide, you can trade that valuable thing for an email address.

After this my knowledge takes a sharp dive.

Once I&#39;ve exchanged my consumer awareness guide for an email address, for what do I use that email address? Perry Marshall has a [How To Write A White Paper mini-course][3] that&#39;s delivered via email over the course of several days. I guess that&#39;s maybe an alternative to a consumer awareness guide - an email mini-course. But were I not to do a mini-course, I don&#39;t know what I would send to salon owners.

(By the way, I think the mini-course thing might actually be perfect for my target market: frantically busy non-techy biz owners who probably wouldn&#39;t sit down and read a PDF, but very well might read 7 short emails.)

So I guess the main thing is that I don&#39;t know what I would send to salon owners either after downloading my awareness guide or completing my mini-course.

 - I don&#39;t know whether I should do a consumer awareness guide PDF or email mini-course
 - I don&#39;t know what I can use the email address for on an ongoing basis

Any thoughts/advice? Thanks in advance.

            <p>Thanks, guys. That’s a good idea about interviewing salon owners and presenting their advice in a mini-course.</p>
<p>I think I answered my own question about what to do at the end of the mini-course: I just got the final email of Perry Marshall’s white paper course and it ends, quite unshockingly, with an offer. There I have it.</p>
<p>(I’ll be curious to see if I get future emails from him.)</p>

            <p>I expect salon owners don’t want to hear about cutting hair so much as they want to hear about running a better business. They have that cutting hair part down already.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/patio11">@patio11</a>’s idea is a good one.  The other thing you should do is ask people what their biggest issue is when they sign up to your list. I stole this idea from Brennan Dunn – just sign up to his list to see what I mean. Then write about the stuff they mention. Simple!</p>

            <p>Consider interviewing a few salon owners and collecting their distilled wisdom about how to run a salon better, then do the editing/curation/etc to turn that into a mini-course.  Presumably some part of their advice will touch upon proper management of salons, which is a good place to plug your thing which manages salons.</p>
