    <title>Hello, I&#39;m Ryan Rosiek from Altum</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hello-im-ryan-rosiek-from-altum/51</link>
    <description>Before I get too far, I should say that my day job is a system engineer and IT manager for Altum, Inc., which is not my company.  That probably puts me a little out of place from the rest of the crowd here in that I do not own my own business.  I hope to change that in the future, so I&#39;m here to learn.

Most of my spare time is spent writing and rewriting applications as a discover better ways to do things and always seem to be in a constant pursuit of perfection...which helps me learn, but also doesn&#39;t let me produce much.  I do enjoy the process, creating/designing things, so I suppose that&#39;s a start.  At some point though, you just need to jump with both feet in.  I&#39;m starting down that road now and looking forward (hopefully) to the experience.</description>

            <p>I think many of us, who are founders, have started by lurking either on the BoS forums or some other place, learning, gathering motivation, etc, before setting out on a venture of our own.</p>
<p>This is one of the main reasons this forum was started.</p>
<p>Welcome, Ryan! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
