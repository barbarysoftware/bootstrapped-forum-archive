    <title>The spambots have found me</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/the-spambots-have-found-me/5353</link>
    <description>Feature Upvote has started to get a few spam comments everyday, and I suspect it will quickly rise. I expected from day one that sooner or later I&#39;d have to deal with this problem. That&#39;s okay by me - I enjoy a good technical challenge like this.

I&#39;ve been investigating using the Akismet spam detection API to help with dealing with the problem. You send it a newly posted comment via a POST endpoint, and it tells you either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. So far I really like it.

What&#39;s been your experience with dealing with comment spam? And with Akismet in particular?</description>

            <p>Totally concur with this. The honeypot technique <a class="mention" href="/u/benjamin_eberlei">@Benjamin_Eberlei</a> lists is far more effective than you’d expect.</p>
<p>I also punish comments that contain more than 3 links. And I keep a list of “stop words” such a “N*ke shoes” or Printer supplies, that have appeared in spam comments before. I do IP-banning as well.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/benjamin_eberlei">@Benjamin_Eberlei</a> has it nailed. We used this method to protect unauthenticated commenting on a very large web portal that was getting 10 million comments a month. Most effective when the fields are set with type of text and hidden with CSS.</p>

            <p>Something I’ve found helpful is to detect the country from the submitting IP (I use Maxmind GeoIP), and watch for trends.  Over the years I’ve found some countries with a 100% spam rate (or at least, 100% unconstructive), and I redirect submissions from countries with high spam rates into a manual review area.  I’m sure that will be controversial, but it’s had the biggest impact on reducing my spam fighting workload.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I also have a lot of keyword filters for common spam phrases, which I tweak whenever something gets through.</p>
<p>I also tried IP lookups with Project Honeypot and some other spam blacklists, but I ultimately turned them off for too many false positives.</p>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/dischwarz">@DiSchwarz</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/benjamin_eberlei">@Benjamin_Eberlei</a>. Your suggestions are helpful. I like that they don’t require a dependency on a realtime API.</p>

            <p>Before you use akismet you can add some more simple protection mechanisms that block bots that are not using a full fledged browser (this might change once spambots start using chrome headless):</p>
<ul>
<li>Add hidden inputs into the form called “url” “email” if you dont use them yet, check that they are empty on the backend. Only bots would provide values here.</li>
<li>Render parts of the form with javascript on document ready, for example a hidden input with a hash that is verified on the backend, or change the form action with javascript to another endpoint, then consider comments spam that sent to the original endpoint.</li>
</ul>
<p>greetings<br>
Benjamin</p>

            <p><a href="http://ASP.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">ASP.NET</a> AJAX Control Toolkit provided similar functionality since 2007. The corresponding component was called NoBot. Here is the link <a href="http://www.ajaxcontroltoolkit.com/NoBot/NoBot.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ajaxcontroltoolkit.com/NoBot/NoBot.aspx</a> but it appears to be a bit dysfunctional now.</p>
<p>“NoBot is a control that attempts to provide CAPTCHA-like bot/spam prevention without requiring any user interaction. This approach is easier to bypass than an implementation that requires actual human intervention, but NoBot has the benefit of being completely invisible.”</p>
<p>If you are brave enough to dig inside NoBot’s code, you’ll get the job done. Basically it does a bunch of server and client side checks. They all appear to be fully transparent to the human user.</p>
<p>Works like a charm even now, 10 years later.</p>
<p>Update: found the relevant source code at <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/AjaxControlToolkit/tree/master/AjaxControlToolkit/NoBot" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/DevExpress/AjaxControlToolkit/tree/master/AjaxControlToolkit/NoBot</a></p>
