    <title>Where to put my content?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/where-to-put-my-content/4268</link>
    <description>So let&#39;s say I&#39;m creating a ton of complementary content which potential customers might find interesting. Where do I put it?

Should I just stuff everything into a blog located at mydomain.com/blog/ or should I create a &quot;resources/articles/howtos/&quot; page for my product at let&#39;s say mydomain.com/product/resources/ and put those articles there? (And link to those pages from the blog whenever I release a new article).

I&#39;m asking both regarding SEO and sales funnel wise. Does it matter? If yes which option should I choose?</description>

            <p>I agree with what some pointed out here, that as long as the content is good, it doesn’t matter where you put it. However, I am leaning towards creating a blog. I personally am more inclined to reading those rather something that’s under a “resources” tab.</p>

            <p>Disclaimer: I’m not a SEO, I just read some stuff.</p>
<p>Placing HOWTO articles as blog posts is confusing.</p>
<p>If it is a help article, please it into KB area. If it is your general thoughts on your business domain, place it into blog. If it is a list of links to supplemental resources, place it onto resources page.</p>
<p>Users and Google like when stuff is in intuitively expected places. Users will press the Back button less, making Google like your pages more.</p>

            <p>I would think as long as the posts themselves have good titles, it doesn’t matter where on your site you put them.</p>
