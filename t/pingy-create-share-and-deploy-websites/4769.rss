    <title>Pingy - Create, share and deploy websites</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/pingy-create-share-and-deploy-websites/4769</link>
    <description>Hey I&#39;m Dave!

I&#39;m very excited to share what I&#39;ve been working on. Pingy is rolling out in March for Mac, and April for Windows. I&#39;d love any and all feedback, comments or questions.

I can&#39;t post links yet but here it is with a space in the middle :) https://pin.gy

Pricing isn&#39;t on the site yet but I&#39;m thinking it will be $9/month for individuals with team/agency pricing to be introduced later.

<p>Just because you <em>can</em> do something doesn’t mean you <em>want</em> to do something. Web Design shouldn’t need to also encompass DevOps.</p>
<p>I would guess that most web designers don’t remember off-hand where the nginx configuration is stored, not to mind what the config syntax for a redirect is, or whether they need a 301 or 302 redirect. They end up googling this info, but whoops it isn’t working, oh I need to reload the server, what’s the command for that? That works, but it looks like my CSS is still cached, how do I invalidate that? You get the picture.</p>

<p>At which point I’m interested to know whom the OP sees as the target audience?</p>
<p>From the video I can deduce that it is a web designer, making sites for paying clients. That designer apparently is not afraid of Sass, but at the same time is not skilled with server configuration?</p>

<p>I didn’t realize you were hosting the deploy as well - if it’s as simple as a single-click deploy, then yes, it completely fulfills that functionality. Nice work!</p>

<p>So Pingy is a staging site. And a web server configurator. And a deployment engine. And a hosting system.</p>
<p>Kinda hard to give it a one-sentence description, which makes it hard to position it.</p>

<p>I made the video myself with Screenflow and a few free/cheap stock video clips. I did the original voiceover but wasn’t really happy with it so I went to a local voiceover guy who did a proper voiceover in his studio for less than €100.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I guess the difference is that they can actually use and browse the site exactly as it is, on any device. You’re not really locked in either, you can just stop using Pingy and go back to whatever you used before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if you remove that, what is left? Automatic deployment? Mmm… a script with tar/gz, scp, tar/gunzip would do that for free and much more flexible than a third-party service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What about minification? HTTP/2? SSL? Server redirects? They are all completely possible to do with other services but there’s a lot involved to get it right. With Pingy it just works out of the box. Also, Pingy is much smarter than a tar and upload script… If you do a deployment and then change a file before doing a re-deploy then Pingy will only upload the minimum set of what needs to be uploaded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m just wondering is the service really provide enough value.</p>

            <p>Have to say this looks pretty great. That video explains perfectly (btw how/who made the video?), and seems like something a designer could immediately see value in, instead of always re-uploading changes to their own server for client feedback. Hope this goes well for you.</p>

<p>What happens if you need a site with a back end like PHP or Ruby?</p>

<p>If it’s just an API then it should work fine. If it’s dynamically generated HTML then Pingy doesn’t support that yet. It will soon though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Side note, the client feedback part in the demo caught my attention. You should checkout my service if you build many sites, addresses that specific issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s really cool. I have spent a little bit of time thinking about collaboration and communication over a Live Share. This is actually very similar to what I was thinking. Very useful tool!</p>

<p>Thanks so much</p>

<p>Is this only for static sites or can you dev/deploy database-driven sites too?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you mean dynamically generated HTML then yes, for the moment Pingy doesn’t support that. It’s in the plans though. If your site is API driven (even WordPress supports this now) then it will work fine with Pingy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does it use for the local dev env?</p>

<p>What do you mean exactly? For compilation I’ve open sourced what I’m using: https:// <a href="http://github.com/davej/piggy-in-the-middle" rel="nofollow noopener">github.com/davej/piggy-in-the-middle</a></p>

<p>And are you using ngrok for the tunneling, or something proprietary?</p>

<p>Yes, that’s basically correct. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Hey I’m Dave!</p>
<p>I’m very excited to share what I’ve been working on. Pingy is rolling out in March for Mac, and April for Windows. I’d love any and all feedback, comments or questions.</p>
<p>I can’t post links yet but here it is with a space in the middle <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> <a href="https://pin.gy" rel="nofollow noopener">https://pin.gy</a></p>
<p>Pricing isn’t on the site yet but I’m thinking it will be $9/month for individuals with team/agency pricing to be introduced later.</p>
<p>(Mod edit: made link clickable)</p>
