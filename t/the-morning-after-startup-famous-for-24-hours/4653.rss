            <p>Clarification:</p>
<p>I think that <em>coming up with a very targeted topic</em> (that meets the above criteria) is not easy.  But I don’t think it’s a lot of <em>hours</em> of  work, although it is “deep work” but there are some economies of scale b/c you can research <em>several</em> ideas at once (and you should b/c you want to toss out the lowest ranked ones.</p>
<p>BTW, I’m not trying to sell you on content marketing. And I agree 100%, you need some evidence that it could work (and provide ROI).</p>

            <p>If anyone is more interested in Realm’s strategies, you can see the articles and videos they host at <a href="https://realm.io/news/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://realm.io/news/</a> where most of the content is guest content.</p>
<p>They perform professional-level video recording of many conferences and publish the videos, complete with transcripts, as well as hosting simple blog articles. These are all mentioned in association with their <span class="mention">@realm</span> twitter handle as well as Realm’s own announcements.</p>
<p>I think they have had at least two people doing this full-time since early days, at least a couple of years.</p>
<p>This is <em>in addition</em> to their own conference and expo booth presentations.</p>
<p>They also host 1 or 2 regular meetups in their SF office.</p>
<p>This is the kind of marketing you can do when you have raised $29M but note the discipline and vision to start doing this relatively early, establishing themselves particularly in the iOS development space as a centre of excellence. Thus, they get people following <span class="mention">@realm</span>.</p>

            <p>Clay, I think Realm’s content mostly hits all three of your points.</p>
<p>In many cases, developers <strong>expect</strong> content to be perishable, eg: migration to Apple’s new Swift language version 3 will be 99% obsolete within a couple of years as nobody will be picking up Swift 2 codebases.</p>
<p>I disagree strongly with your assertion <em>the above are actually not a lot of work</em> because I think writing Evergreen content <em>as a planned activity</em> is actually very hard, to come up with original content. I would need to see at least dozens of examples before you convince me otherwise.</p>
<p>There is an extraordinary amount of <em>survivorship bias</em> when people recommend marketing and especially content-based marketing strategies.</p>

            <p>Andy,</p>
<p>Do you think that Realm’s content marketing (every article) meets these criteria?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ties in to their marketing</strong>. (I.e., the article <em>naturally</em> leads users to what they are selling. eg., my Mic article would be GREAT for someone selling tech support services, but not for someone selling mics or speech therapy software.  BTW, Dan Norris is the one I stole that idea from in (Content Machine). He is extremely strategic about his topics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evergreen</strong> - solves a problem/question that <strong>users</strong> will have for many years to come.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is <strong>the canonical source</strong> for the above problem/question.  Is clearly the best resource for humans (solves their problem.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>BTW, the above are actually not a lot of work. (For my new article it was probably 30% of the total effort). But it is by far the most important.</p>
<p>Where you aim is far more important than how often you shoot or the caliber of your bullet!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>You are right. It is hard to believe. There is a lot of content out there. But <em>good</em> writing is rare. And the more poor content there is, the more your gold content rises to the top.</p>
<p>Yep, it would definitely be hard to know <em>in advance</em> that an article will last 2-3 years. And it takes some expertise to find the right topic and write a good article that <em>humans</em> will find useful. That article needs.</p>
<p><strong>I’m in the top 5, 6 years later</strong><br>
The way I discovered this myself is I saw that we get a lot of (accidental) traffic for  “how to fix my windows microphone”. I looked and we (Bungalow Software)  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fix+my+windows+microphone&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS704US704&amp;oq=fix+my+windows+microphone&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5119j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow noopener">are in the top 5</a>, for this <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20101011152423/http://www.bungalowsoftware.com/faq/fix-microphone.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">article I wrote 6+ years ago</a>.</p>
<p><strong>But</strong> there was a <strong>problem</strong> with this article. Can you guess what it is?</p>
          <a href="http://content.screencast.com/users/MrAnalogy/folders/Snagit/media/e57e54fb-ef53-4a81-9540-d732e7a17a8d/01.02.2017-12.22.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">
            <img src="http://content.screencast.com/users/MrAnalogy/folders/Snagit/media/e57e54fb-ef53-4a81-9540-d732e7a17a8d/01.02.2017-12.22.png" width="690" height="330">
          </a>

<p>The problem is that this article isn’t the <em>right kind</em> of traffic for us.  We make speech therapy software. The Mic page was just a FAQ for our users. But that traffic is <em>incredibly untargeted</em>. If we’re lucky .001% of those folks are interested in speech therapy software. So I did a little experiment. I spent a few hours doing keyword research and wrote an article on a therapy technique. We are <span class="hashtag">#1</span> for searches on that topic and it’s converting at about 1% to <em>free</em> trial signups. (A bit too early to tell how many paid signups that will generate. (It’s generating as many free signups/month as would cost us $200 via adwords). (And past conversion calculations show that we at least breakeven on Adwords traffic.</p>
<p>But my article is soo much better than anything out there that I’m confident it will stay highly ranked for a long time.<br>
So it’ll be interesting to see how it does.</p>
<p><strong>Caveat:</strong><br>
I recently updated that article and spent wayyyy too much time on the graphics, etc. But I enjoyed it. Total time invested on that page is probably 15 to 20 hours.  BUT… if it has a life of 5 years then that’s $200 x 12 x 5=$12K.</p>
<p>You almost need to engineer/design the articles. A bit of up front effort could really increase the Benefit/Cost ratio.  The mic article took me maybe 2 or 3 hours to write. Much less than the new article.</p>
<p>I apologize for (deliberately) being vague on the ROI on the new page I created. I don’t want to provide a competitor with too much information. (We have a VC funded competitor to the tune of $4M or so).</p>
<p><strong>The Tipping Effect</strong><br>
If you have the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> spot for a topic, you get a huge “tipping effect”.  The longer your article is around, the <em>higher</em> google tends to rank it.  So, if you can keep that <span class="hashtag">#1</span> rank for 6 months or so, i’d suspect you can easily keep it a lot longer (especially if you do a small tweak to it ever now and then).</p>
<p>See what our own Patrick McKenzie wrote about <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2007/11/18/putting-the-green-in-evergreen/" rel="nofollow noopener">evergreen content</a></p>
<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Content must be very specifically target to your market niche, and complement your marketing.</li>
<li>The content must be <em>the best</em> (as rated by humans) on the topic. It should be <em>the canonical article</em> on the topic.</li>
<li>Topic should be evergreen. Don’t write about the latest headline. Write something timeless. Like, <a href="http://bungalowsoftware.com/faq/fix-microphone.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">How to fix your microphone</a> or <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/" rel="nofollow noopener">How to measure the quality of your software work enviroment</a>

<p>I find it very hard to accept that estimate that even very good inbound content has that kind of lifespan.</p>
<p>That is where your scenario falls down for me - I would want to see some <strong>very</strong> compelling examples of such work which had remained a good source of inbound attraction for that period.</p>
<p>I am not a marketer. Whilst I have my own, currently small startup, I have also had a <em>day job</em> at Realm for the last 18 months and watched their superb content marketing machine in operation. They give away, and now sell, developer tools and put a vast amount of effort into content generation. That gives me a level for the <em>gold standard</em> both in cost, effort and continual engagement. I really struggle to compare that with the <em>one shot</em> $20K engagement.</p>
<p>In particular, content marketing has been accelerating for the last few years to the point where we are utterly drowning in content. Without a continual, adaptive strategy, how can any business keep up?</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/shanelabs">@shanelabs</a> that might be worth considering, although I’m not aware of any payment processors that offer affiliate program integration for merchants? (well besides CCBill, but they’re mainly for porn)  I am aware of affiliate networks (Commission Junction, Shareasale, etc) - they help to onboard new affiliates and manage the payouts, but of course they take an additional cut.  The other options are buying software like Post Affiliate Pro or rolling your own - but that means means you have to spend time paying out affiliates, and protecting yourself from fraud (ie. cookie stuffing, affiliates competing with you on Adsense, redirects from typo domains, etc).</p>

<p>That’s exactly what affiliates do. Have you considered offering an affiliate program for whatever your product is? To find your first affiliates try reaching out to your existing customers. Many payment processors already have the functionality for you, you just need to add some extra js to your website to cookie referrals. Start out at 50% commission. Sounds steep, but the other 50% is money you probably wouldn’t have made without the affiliate.</p>

            <p>You are <em>quite</em> right. There are no guarantees, and I wouldn’t roll the dice to find out @ $20K.<br>
But also, don’t make the mistake of an Economist who knows the <em>cost</em> over everything and the <em>value</em> of nothing ;0).</p>
<p>If I were providing such a service (or looking for one) it seems like having some introductory offer as a starting point (and trust builder) for, say $500 (assuming that I have some confidence in this person) to achieve some goal, perhaps with some part of payment contingent on accomplishing that goal in a measurable way.</p>

<p>I think my biggest issue is that there’s no guarantee of that $20K plunk-down (from your example) ever paying off.  That kind of gamble might be ok for a larger company, but not for most bootstrappers.</p>
<p>nitpick: $4K/month over 3 years = $144000, so w/ initial $20K investment that’s 620% ROI, no?</p>
<p>EDIT: nevermind, if that’s a compounding $4k, 1500% ROI sounds about right</p>

<p>I just googled “reviews of software marketing agencies” and most didn’t really fit the above, or wanted $100-$200/hr.  Per hour.  No thanks.</p>
<p>So maybe I’m just dreaming here, but seems like something like this could be mostly automated by scraping google.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think the critical thing is that marketing works best when it gathers info about what the customers want and think, and that only works if it can influence development, both in terms of <em>which</em> features you build and also the User Interface (terminology you use in buttons, etc.)</p>
<p>That’s going to require a good working relationship with a lot of trust on both sides.</p>
<p>Also, good marketing takes a long time to show results.  And, similar to development, there’s a lot of up front work with a very “long tail” of revenue.</p>
<p>So, we are back to trust again.  The service they provide may indeed be worth $100 an hour <em>over an “evergreen” period of several years</em>.<br>
I.e., lets say that for $20K a consultant:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creates some good inbound content (that attracts exactly the right kind of visitors, who convert)</li>
<li>Builds a Drip email campaign (again, that converts</li>
</ol>
<p>And lets say that is then fully automated and brings in $4K in new business a month. Business you didn’t have before.</p>
<p>That’s a 5 month Payback period with probably a 2-3 year lifespan (maybe longer) and an ROI of 1500%</p>
<p>Q: is the issue that you don’t know WHAT you should do in terms of marketing, or that you just have zero interest in it?</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/napoleond">@napoleond</a> my budget is $50-$100/<strong>month</strong>.  Obviously that’s not enough to pay for someone else to sufficiently interact with social media on my product’s behalf.</p>
<p>But I do think that is a fair price for robust, automated monitoring of forums + blogs + social media of anything having to do with my product, my competitor’s products, or my target market.  Send me a daily summary email of all the chatter that matches my product space.  Give me some control of how fine-grained it is.  Maybe perform some sentiment analysis on each piece of chatter and categorize it, anything to make it easier to digest.  I’m not aware of any services out there that do this well (ie. I have not had much success with Google Alerts simply picking up forum threads or blog comments).</p>
<p>I may have just convinced myself of the next thing I should work on <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/ian">@ian</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/cliffordoravec">@cliffordoravec</a> thanks, very helpful info. Sounds like it is far more valuable to just focus on the basics (ie.

<p>I wouldn’t have it any other way <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’m in whole hearted agreement with <a class="mention" href="/u/ian">@Ian</a> in that it’s <em>tough</em> out there to break through the noise.  SEO, viral loops, and (sort of like viral loops) word of mouth are usually the primary marketing tools in a bootstrapper’s toolbox.  Why? 1) they’re typically “free” to execute (like a puppy dog) and 2) they’re not high-touch.  When those fail to work, I would say don’t hesitate to whip out a direct sales approach.  Direct sales can often yield results much faster than passive marketing (but is very high-touch by definition).  But what it usually comes down to is a lot of trial and error to find what works for you and your market.  Start with the basics and only get more sophisticated/complicated/complex when those fail to yield any results.</p>
<p>I’m also in agreement that paying someone to market and sell your app would make a ton of sense.  Unfortunately, that approach almost never works.  Usually because you can’t afford to pay a dedicated person to do so.  And also usually because the majority of marketing agencies tend to be 1) expensive and 2) will only operate on time and material and refuse to be pinned down by any sort of incentive-based compensation or tangible targets.</p>
<p>But don’t look at all of this as a bad thing necessarily.</p>
<p>Doing the marketing and selling yourself has actual benefits that pay off.</p>
<p>For starters, you’ll get to understand your customers better than anyone else.  You’ll be able to use insights you have in conversations to guide your product roadmap as well as your marketing plan.  And not only that, but at some point when you can afford to hire a junior-level employee, you can teach them the process that you followed (systematizing!) rather than hire an “expert” who knows nothing about your market or customers and just winds up spending a lot of your money while failing to deliver any tangible benefit.</p>

            <p>I’ve never had any luck with outsourcing any marketing. At a certain scale it can probably be done, bootstrapper scale isn’t that scale <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>The people you can afford don’t care enough about your product to do the job right because you can’t afford to pay them enough to care!</p>
<p>I’m pretty pessimistic on most modern marketing techniques at the bootstrapper level outside of SEO. Much of it can work in certain circumstances, but there’s so much noise that unless you have a very unique angle (and likely a unique individual personality) it’s hard to make a dent out there.</p>
<p>IMHO most bootstrappers should be focused on some kind of SEO plan and more importantly making sure their apps have an inherent virality. I don’t mean viral in the sense of overnight you get thousands of customers, but some manner by which users of your product are exposing your product to other people.</p>
<p>A common example is a ‘powered by’ link. A ‘powered by’ link doesn’t work in all contexts but that kind of idea. Where your product can be discovered through your customers audience natively as part of the experience of using the app without any extra effort on your customers part.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/timbowhite">@timbowhite</a> how much would you pay for a service like that? I run a consulting company that both develops software <em>and</em> helps regular brick-and-mortar businesses with marketing, so I think we’d be well-suited to doing something like what you describe. Our going rate <em>is</em> usually in the $100-200 per hour range as you’ve found, but (a) you’d be surprised what we can accomplish in an hour and (b) more importantly, there is probably an opportunity for some leverage here. One person monitoring social media for multiple software companies at once shouldn’t cost each of them $200/hour <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>One thing I’d like to see is research of various agencies/services that will promote and market my software product for me.</p>
<p>I’m an indie dev. I’d gladly pay someone else to did this shit so I can focus on making the product better for the customer.  Well, as long as it’s an affordable service.  Does such a thing even exist?</p>
<p>This type of service should gain an understanding of the basics of my product: who is the target market, what it can do for the target market, and why it has any value for the target market.  Maybe I fill out a form with this info, or we have a conference call. Then they handle the stuff like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Managing the product’s social media accounts.  Gain followers.  Reply to tweets. Comment on relevant posts.</li>
<li>Scan forums, blogs, etc. for leads, comments and reply with relevancy.</li>
<li>Contact relevant bloggers, notify of them of the product, see if they’d be interested in writing about, or having a guest post, what the cost would be, etc.</li>
<li>Research and relay back to me the frustrations people are having with competitors’ products.</li>
<li>Being aware of what constitutes spam, and staying the hell away from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>If that’s too much to ask, I’d be content with this service simply doing the research and monitoring most of the above list, without doing any replies/posts/actions, and simply providing me with the info.</p>
<p>Most companies hire someone to manually do this right? “Marketer”, “Growth Hacker”, whatever.  I can’t afford to hire an employee, and I don’t want the permanence, nor the revenue sharing, of bringing on a non-technical co-founder.</p>
<p>I just googled “reviews of software marketing agencies” and most didn’t really fit the above, or wanted $100-$200/hr.  <strong>Per hour.</strong>  No thanks.</p>
<p>So maybe I’m just dreaming here, but seems like something like this could be mostly automated by scraping google.</p>
