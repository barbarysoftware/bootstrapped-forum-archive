    <title>Business of Software Conference USA - a deal for Bootstrappers</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/business-of-software-conference-usa-a-deal-for-bootstrappers/5235</link>
    <description>Dearly beloved Bootstrappers, 

**[Here’s the final schedule for Business of Software Conference USA.](http://businessofsoftware.org/schedule/)** 

Trying to keep it brief…

* **When/Where:** 18-20 Sept, Boston, MA
* **Who/What:** Single track, with a focus on growing long term, sustainable, profitable software businesses. In the words of Joel Spolsky, &quot;a conference where every speaker would keynote at other events&#39;. Founders/CEOs and some software industry/experts sharing what they know in a single stream conference - Anil Dash, Seth Godin, Natalie Nagele, Jason Cohen, Brennan Dunn, Bridget Harris and more… 
* **How much:** Until end of August, $1895 exc workshop / $2195 inc workshop. (Though as you are smart enough to be in this forum, if you register for a conference ticket before end of August, let me know and I will throw in a workshop pass at no charge).
* **Why come?** Because you think most conferences suck because they are filled with sponsors, chancers and hangers on and you want to hang with your peers who want to build a business for the long term.

If you want to know more, [this post has some stories from previous attendees talking about the value they get from coming and the problems we help you solve](http://businessofsoftware.org/2017/07/come-to-bosbecause/).

Would love to see you there. We would also love any thoughts on schedule/speakers and what you’d like to see at future BoS events…</description>
