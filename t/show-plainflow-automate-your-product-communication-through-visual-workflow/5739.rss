    <description>üëã  everyone, Leonardo here.

I recently launched [plainflow.com/](https://www.plainflow.com/) a SaaS product to help SaaS companies automate their product communication using their favorite tools and through visual workflows.

Pissed off by traditional old-school marketing automation tools we created a modern automation product for SaaS able to collect all your customer data (we integrate with Segment) in a central place and let you take actions.

We currently integrate with Segment, MadKudu, Clearbit, Email, and webhook. 

Below an example of workflow to send a truly personalized email based on the new user&#39;s job role. üëá

            <p>I get the idea of your product - UX/marketing-speak notwithstanding. But you need 2 things in your headline: ‚ÄúAutomate customer journeys using your favourite marketing and sales tools.‚Äù</p>
<ul>
<li>who is this product for (presumedly whoever owns marketing)?</li>
<li>what‚Äôs the differentiating benefit?</li>
</ul>
<p>Something like:<br>
Automatically connect your marketing and sales tools for increased conversion and retention. Plainflow, the Zapier* for Marketing Managers.</p>
<ul>
<li>You want a disclaimer somewhere, re zapier not affiliated, blah blah, but ‚ÄúZapier for Marketing Managers‚Äù is a powerful image.</li>
</ul>

            <p>I have 20 years experience with the internet and marketing but I have absolutely no idea what this product does.</p>
<p>You need to simplify the sell so your grandma can understand.</p>
<p>You need to explain in simple terms what exactly it is and what it can do for me.</p>

            <p>plainflow looks interesting.</p>
<p>I do have a question: How do you handle the upcoming European Data Privacy regulation GDPR?  Especially regarding consent?  I‚Äôm asking this, because GDPR will impact nearly all SaaS working with EU customer data.  A SaaS like yours (or a CRM for that matter) has no direct contact with the customers, but still must comply with explicit consent?</p>
