    <title>Exit Strategy for Tech as Investment Service</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/exit-strategy-for-tech-as-investment-service/5050</link>
    <description>Hello All,

I&#39;m Stanley, co-founder of a dev studio based where we primary build web and mobile applications for businesses and startups. 

So we recently introduced a model called startx that enables us to build applications for startups/ideas owners for half the price + equity. We have between 12 - 18 months time frame to work the startups in building and maintaining their project. After that time period, we want to exit and allow the startup to buy back the equity. 

My questions are;

1. What is the best way to exit in this kind of situation
2. Assuming we don&#39;t exit at the end of period, should we negotiate a new deal with them to continuing providing CTO as a Service to them

Thanks for your response</description>
