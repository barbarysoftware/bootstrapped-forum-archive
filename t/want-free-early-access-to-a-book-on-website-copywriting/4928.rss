    <title>Want free &amp; early access to a book on website copywriting?</title>

    <description>Hey, folks!

I just wrapped up a short book called &quot;Websites that Convert: the fundamentals of writing compelling website copy.&quot;

It&#39;s specifically for founders struggling to convey in words how awesome their product is (i.e., founders who don&#39;t consider themselves &quot;marketers&quot; or &quot;writers&quot;), and it launches on Product Hunt next week.

**If you&#39;d like a free copy before it goes live, send me a message with the best way to reach you, and I&#39;ll hook you up :)**

PS: If you&#39;re wondering &quot;Who&#39;s this person?,&quot; I&#39;ve joined a few conversations but mostly lurked so far. I&#39;m Claire, and I run LoveYourCustomers.co. I was previously Director of Marketing at Calendly. üëã</description>
