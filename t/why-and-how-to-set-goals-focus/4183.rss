    <title>Why and How to set **GOALS** &amp; **FOCUS**</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/why-and-how-to-set-goals-focus/4183</link>
    <description>When I first started my software [company](http://www.BungalowSoftware.com) 20+ years ago, I was very focused. I&#39;d pick one thing and work on it for a few months ( new features, sales, marketing, etc.).

In the last decade I got less focused.

Lately I&#39;ve been getting more focused. For example, I got our blog up and running (took about 3 months). So that&#39;s ALL I did for that time.  Now I&#39;m updating the UX for our flagship product.  Then I&#39;ll probably go back to the blog again for a could of months.

I&#39;m looking for tips and benefits.

1.  Pick an Outcome
Should be a [SMART](http://topachievement.com/smart.html) goal.  


2. All activity for a period of time should impact on that Goal.
3. Avoids distraction.
4. Makes it easier to measure impact (compared to pursuing several Outcomes at once.  
A big push in one metric (say, newsletter signups, or new Visitors or conversions from Visitor to User) is much easier to track. This is especially important for smaller companies.

**Any suggestions of _good_ blogs or podcasts?**

I just listened to a good episide from the Drift folks: [The power of  Focus (Setting Goals for your startup)](http://topachievement.com/smart.htmlhttp://seekingwisdom.io/13-how-to-set-goals-for-your-startup-and-the-power-of-focus/)</description>

            <p>Yep, I think that’s called TimeBoxing.<br>
It’s sort making use of the reverse of Parkinson’s Law: Work expands to fill time. So you constrain time to get more concentrated effort, rather than spending our on forums. like. this. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>What works for me is splitting the day into time slots… 4 hours of this then a prize… lol 2 hours of this and then I am done… It is incredible how much more I can do when I get into that mode in 6 hours than I can do in 12 in a scattered mode…</p>
<p>I find that I can do this for like a project or something… but I keep drifting out of it… got to work on discipline… lol</p>
