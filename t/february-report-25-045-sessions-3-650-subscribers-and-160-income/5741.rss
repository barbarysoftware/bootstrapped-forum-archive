    <title>February Report: 25,045 Sessions, 3,650 Subscribers and $160 Income</title>

    <description>Hey, bootstrappers!

I am Rich Clominson, maker of [Failory](https://failory.com), a bootstrapped startup where we weekly publish interviews with failed businesses.

A few months ago we decided to become a transparent startup and begin sharing our numbers. We have just published our February report, in which we not only talk about our analytics, newsletter growth, revenue and expenses, but we also describe every marketing strategy that let us achieve 25,045 sesiones, 3,650 email subscribers and $160 in Income.

Hope you enjoy it!

<h3><a href="https://failory.com/february-report" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">February Report: 25,045 Visits, 3,650 Subscribers and $160</a></h3>

<p>February was a special month. We had a lot of time to publish new great interviews and work on different features. This resulted in a lot of new users on our website, hundreds of email subscribers and our first dollar (which, in fact, were $160!).</p>
