    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Scotty, bootstrapping a productized copywriting service</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-scotty-bootstrapping-a-productized-copywriting-service/2947</link>
    <description>Hi everyone, 

My name is Scotty Truong. I&#39;m a copywriter and co-founder of an education agent company in my home country Vietnam. I&#39;m also involved in a few software projects.

I&#39;ve been bootstrapping a productized copywriting service. Think Wpcurve for small copywriting jobs.

Looking forward to contributing wherever I can be useful, and learning from everyone.</description>

            <p>Good stuff.  I’ve been kicking around the idea of helping some of my customers with content (I run an email app).</p>
<p>What does your pricing look like?</p>

            <p>wow! scotty am thinking of doing something similar here in the Philippines. Been listening to Dan Norris interviews now <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"><br>
I’m thinking of focusing on doing product descriptions but looking at wpcurve it seems more broad<br>
the discussion about the difficulty of hiring good copywriter is insightful<br>
would love to keep updated on your journey with this<br>
i also think the book built to sell is relevant for this as the story basically focused on a small niche, systemized it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Yes, I agree. It’s very difficult to hire good copywriters. I tried to outsource copywriting for my business a few times. I always got disappointed, and ended up doing it myself.</p>
<p>The problem is we never knew for sure if a new subject line would increase the open rate or not. All we can do is come up with hypotheses, create variations, and listen to what the market is telling us.</p>

            <p>I think Headlines (esp. email subjects) are the “low hanging fruit” here.<br>
I bet you could go in and in 10 minutes improve an email subject.<br>
And measure the improvement w/ A/B testing.</p>
<p>Good copywriters are really hard to find.</p>
<p>Do you have any before/after examples of your work?</p>
<p>Have you gotten an idea of what your biggest “obstacle” is to “sales”?</p>
<p>(I’m working on a course on “validating your MVP” - it’s currently on hold b/c the person I’m doing it with is busy with other stuff, but I’m still collecting information).</p>
<p>I suspect one big issue (from my experience hiring copywriters) is that you <strong>don’t know what you’re getting</strong> (both in terms of cost and value).  If I could just show you a subject line and then see what you came up with, with a price tag, then I can just decide whether to pay that.<br>
Or if I KNEW the new subject would increase my open rate from 30% to 60% that’s worth $X</p>
<p>But it doesn’t work that way.</p>
<p>So you have to slowly establish trust.</p>
<p>Have you considered having some sort of introductory offer, like “I’ll improve an email subject for $X”</p>

            <p>Hi Clay,</p>
<p>Basically our company works with a high-school student who wants to study abroad to find which college is a good fit for him. We earn a commission from the schools when we refer a student.</p>
<p>Very good points Clay. Right now, there’s only me. So the clients will get the same copywriter each time they send us a job. I limit the number of clients we take on, so I think I can handle it.</p>
<p>I’ve actually been thinking about it a lot. Right now we only focus on small jobs like writing a drip email, optimize a headline, etc… as from my conversations with small businesses, and from what I experience in my business as well, these small jobs are what they need the most.</p>
<p>For example, sometimes I want to implement a drip email campaign or a cart abandonment sequence, but I just can’t find the time. And good copywriters are near impossible to find on Elance or Odesk.</p>

            <p>Welcome!</p>
<p>What is an Education Agency?</p>
<p>Copywriting is (in my experience), a very high skill area.  Would a client in your productize copywriting service have access to the same copywriter each time?</p>
<p>(I find that the rapport b/t client and copywriter is critical, as is the copywriter’s knowledge of the industry and audience.</p>
