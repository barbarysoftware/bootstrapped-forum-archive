    <description>@andy and I discuss why he’s created [a new product](https://www.easydatatransform.com/), even though he already has two successful products.

<p>Not yet. But I have already started on the work for that.</p>

<p>I don’t think that will cause a problem. Depends on what exactly you are doing.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think it works quite well. Putting it at the bottom means you can’t show many rows without eating into the transform graph pane. Also you can full screen it with one click.</p>

</aside>
<p>In the first approximation, that is not an issue. I can always do some small script magic to rename the inputs into a predefined set of names.</p>

<p>What is the planned business price for Easy Data Transform?</p>

<p>Good question. Haven’t decided yet. Maybe $99 per year per user.</p>

<p>I just finished a bunch of DIY scripts to produce a few reports for our business based on a few large spreadsheets. Now I think I could have done that faster and easier with the EDT, but I need it to run automatically on a daily basis. Is it possible?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you leave it running it automatically detects that an input file has changed, runs the transforms and creates the output.</p>
<p>That doesn’t work if the input file name keeps changing though. You would have to point the input to the new file - which only takes a few seconds but is a hassle. I am thinking about how to make it work better for transforming batches of files or doing scheduled work.</p>

<p>Also, I think the better name is Easy Tables Transform. Given that it doesn’t work with data in any format but tables, eh?</p>

</aside>
<p>It can also transform lists. ;0)</p>
<p>Also, naming is a nightmare. Don’t want to start picking at that scab again…</p>
