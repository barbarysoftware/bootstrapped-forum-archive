    <title>A/B testing and tracking landing page performance</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/a-b-testing-and-tracking-landing-page-performance/785</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve recently launched a landing page for a product in development, [listdrop.com](http://listdrop.com).

There are actually 3 different versions with copy that addresses a few different pain points I&#39;ve seen out there.

I looked at unbounce, but it seemed expensive for what I needed. So I just created a static html landing page (well, with a little help from bootstrap). 

Once I had one version I liked, I cloned it two times and tweaked the copy. So I have landing1.html, landing2.html, and landing3.html.

I wanted to A/B test (is it ok to have 3 variants in an A/B test?). So, I wrote a simple node.js app that uses a counter and serves up the next variant in a round robin fashion on each hit on the site. Also keeping total count of how many times each was served.

I wanted to track which landing pages converted best into an email signup. I created a hidden &#39;LandingPage&#39; field in mailchimp, and each landing page has a different value in the signup form. So now I can see in the mailchimp subscribers view what landing page caused the signup.

From the total counts, I can see how many people saw a particular page, then with the field in mailchimp, I can calculate the conversion rate.

Does this seem like a good way to do this? How are you guys doing landing pages and testing them?

            <p>Big fan of VWO here as well and we have used it quite a bit when testing small content changes.</p>
<p>Similar to Ryan, when it comes to testing major changes we went with custom code since it made it much easier to do major swaps.</p>

            <p>Google experiments looks good. And would eliminate the need for server side code.</p>
<p>I just tried it out, and one thing that I don’t like is the url you end up with. I’d really like to have a clean looking url when someone goes to the page.</p>
<p>Do you get this extra query string in your url? Maybe I setup something wrong?</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/bootstrapped/16/789bb4ee6bccdd1e.png" width="690" height="66"> </p>
<p>So, for now, I’ve enhanced my previous solution by using a custom variable in my google analytics js (each page variant has a different value for the variable). I also setup a goal page. So, I can now see the flow from each landing page to the goal in GA. (In the Goal Flow reporting section).</p>

            <p>It is fine to have more than 2 variants in an A/B test. Your implementations sounds ok, but a little labout intensive. I use <a href="http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com">http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com</a> , which I think is very good (but not free). I used to use the free Google website optimizer, before they killed it.</p>

            <p>Personally I’m using ‘experiments’ in Google Analytics. It’s handy in the sense that<br>
a) you should be using GA anyway, and its build on top of GA in a simple way<br>
b) it automatically tracks and compares the different options and calculates the probability that one version is better than another<br>
c) you can set up a number of different versions and compare.<br>
d) you can easily filter your audience in different ways and compare (e.g. new visits vs. returning visits)<br>
e) its free</p>
<p>You just need to set up the experiment in the GA dashboard, and then copy/paste some JS code into each page.</p>
