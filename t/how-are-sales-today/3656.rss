    <title>How Are Sales Today</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-are-sales-today/3656</link>
    <description>If you&#39;ve been listening to the past few episodes of [the show](http://bootstrapped.fm), you probably know that I&#39;m working on a new app for Stripe users called &quot;How Are Sales Today?&quot;.

The app runs in your Windows system tray or your Mac menu bar, and allows you to see your Stripe sales, refunds, events, and subscription-related metrics, without the need to have your data go through a third-party service.

If you&#39;re interested in signing up for the beta, you can either subscriber at [http://quanticinsights.com](http://quanticinsights.com), or just send me a direct message.

Here is a sneak preview screenshot of the app:

            <p>Quintu was written in C++ with Qt. I’ve used Qt on another product as well. It’s really good. JavaFX is another good option for cross platform desktop work.</p>

            <p>Quintu was an old domain I’ve had for years. I wasn’t able to find anything good for the rebranding, so I used one of the domains I already owned.</p>
<p>There have been a few requests for making the app a one-off payment. I think this gives it a stronger marketing stance too, with everything else out there being subscription-based.</p>

            <p>Quintu? How did you come up with that name <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>And did users really complain about recurring pricing? I mean, I asked the question above, but that was for my curiosity.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: ‘How Are Sales Today’ is no longer priced as a monthly subscription (as per user feedback). I also rebranded the product as <strong>Quintu</strong>. More info at <a href="http://quintu.com">http://quintu.com</a></p>

            <p>The price is subscription-based because there is a fair amount of ongoing upkeep that needs to happen to keep HAST working properly and report accurate numbers.</p>

            <p>Andrey,</p>
<p>I’ve had “HAST” running for a few days. I feel you’ve already hit a pretty good mix of usefulness, UI, and non-obtrusiveness.</p>

<p>Oh I see. Must be because the host is in NY, or maybe there were a lot of people hitting the server at that time. I’ll keep an eye out.</p>
<p>I agree with you about the Stripe key issue. I’ll have to look into ways of letting the user know that the Stripe key isn’t being compromised in any way.</p>

<p>Andrey, I meant downloading the app was slow. In my case, it was the Mac version. I could watch the 0.1 MB tick over as it downloaded.</p>
<p>I think the message is very clear that no data passes through your server.</p>

<p>I’m quite new to using Stripe, and this is the first time I’ve ever shared my secret key with any other product. I’d also be reticent to give it to a SaaS product without first looking for some confirmation about who they are and what they need the key for.</p>

            <p>Baremetrics is a full fledged thing, ( and <a class="mention" href="/u/shpigford">@Shpigford</a> , the founder is a member of these forums <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> ).</p>
<p>My app is a smaller, desktop-focused utility, which allows you to see your sales and refunds, and some SaaS metrics, at a glance, and has desktop notifications for convenience.</p>
<p>Once the app comes out of beta, there will be a price-point, yes.</p>

            <p>Great idea! I love it! I would definitely 2nd <a class="mention" href="/u/stevemcleod">@SteveMcLeod</a>’s notion to explain what you do with the secret key more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Does Baremetrics do anything like this? Seems like you also might have to compete with them, which I wouldn’t want to do, but maybe you do!</p>
<p>Is this just for fun or do you have a rev plan up your sleeve? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Obviously you’ve probably thought through most of this just curious more than anything and wanted to give some feedback as well!</p>

<p>That’s right. The current version is USD only.</p>

<p>That’s right. Current month to date is being compared with all of last month. I find this calculation useful in my own metrics, but you may be correct. I’ll have to take a look at some other feedback to see what’s better here. Maybe both will go in eventually.</p>

<p>I took a quick look…</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It basically works for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Downloading was really slow. I guess that’s due to your host.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It shows my revenue as $ but actually my revenue is tracked in EUR. Numbers are correct, currency is wrong, I think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I didn’t know you at all, I’d have been worried about entering my Stripe API secret key. Maybe you could add a link describing exactly what you’ll do with the key, and why I should trust you.</p>

            <p>And of course it has a DLL API for 3rd parties to write gateways to other payment platforms?</p>

            <p>If you’ve been listening to the past few episodes of <a href="http://bootstrapped.fm">the show</a>, you probably know that I’m working on a new app for Stripe users called “How Are Sales Today?”.</p>
<p>The app runs in your Windows system tray or your Mac menu bar, and allows you to see your Stripe sales, refunds, events, and subscription-related metrics, without the need to have your data go through a third-party service.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in signing up for the beta, you can either subscriber at <a href="http://quanticinsights.com">http://quanticinsights.com</a>, or just send me a direct message.</p>
<p>Here is a sneak preview screenshot of the app:</p>
