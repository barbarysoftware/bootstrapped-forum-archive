    <title>Beware of company</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/beware-of-company/3150</link>
    <description>I know many people like to get nice animated videos done for their website, well beware of the company we used Stun*ly.

After paying out $335 and getting some initial contact with them to write the script they then dropped off the radar. Over several weeks we emailed but got no response. They closed our Bootcamp project page for the video. After finally making contact via Facebook we said what is going on, can we get the video done or get a refund which they refused both and said we should contact PayPal to get a refund. Left us no other option than to report it to the bank as fraud.</description>
