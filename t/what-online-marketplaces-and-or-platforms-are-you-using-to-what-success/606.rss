    <description>Hi,

I am researching on online API based platforms such as shopify apps and salesforce.com for which you can build apps and leverage their client base.

Did anyone tried this platforms ?

Does anyone know similar platforms with potential ?

Thanks</description>

            <p>Thanks all, it looks like this list of marketplaces and ecosystems can be a good way to bootstrap and access an existing market as <a class="mention" href="/u/msmithstubbs">@msmithstubbs</a> pointed out.</p>

            <p>I’ve built apps for the Shopify platform and found it to be a great platform to work on. Tictail, another ecommerce provider, have recently opened up their own app store. It’s early days but I think it has a lot of potential (<a href="https://tictail.com/developers/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://tictail.com/developers/</a>)</p>
<p>There are drawbacks to being dependent on a platform but it also has advantages if you are bootstrapping: you can tap into an existing market very quickly.</p>

            <p>We are going to make a marketplace in <a href="https://backbeam.io" rel="nofollow noopener">https://backbeam.io</a> but won’t be ready till first quarter of 2014. You will be able to make white-label web and mobile apps and sell them in the marketplace. Ready to be used. No need to do deploys, server maintenance, etc. Ping me if you are interested.</p>

            <p>Haven’t used it yet, but I like the look of the <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Atlassian Marketplace</a>. They get some impressive download numbers for paid add-ons and they can handle all the payments side of things for you I believe.</p>
<p>I’m also currently researching custom <a href="http://apps.splunk.com/develop/" rel="nofollow noopener">Splunk Apps</a> but I’m not sure about the monitization story yet. I’d be very interested in hearing from anyone who has written one before. Or to hear people’s opinions of them in general if you’ve used one</p>
