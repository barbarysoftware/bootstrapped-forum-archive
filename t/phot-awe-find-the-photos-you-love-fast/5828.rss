    <title>Phot-Awe - Find the Photos You Love - Fast!</title>

    <description>Hi fellow bootstrappers,

We&#39;ve made Phot-Awe - https://phot-awe.com - to help you make sense of those 20K+ Photos you have on your PC and on your Devices (Phones/Tablets, Cameras, Sticks).  For now, it&#39;s Windows-only***

The Basics: 
* View thousands of Photos like a boss: see the Current Photo, while not having to lose sight of surrounding Photos. 
* Rate. Mark as Favorites. Add Tags. Set Notes. 
* See the important details about the Current Photo.

The Awesome:  
* Blazingly Fast. Easy. No Wasted Space. 
* View all your Photos on the World Map. Expand to any World Location for more Accuracy.
* View all your Photos on the Timeline. Find Your Moments in no-time! You can even combine the World Map with the Timeline to find just what you&#39;re looking for.
* Seamless Synchronization with your Phones/Tables/USB Sticks/Cameras: Plug it in, say &quot;Yes&quot;, Let Phot-Awe do the work!
* Insane Filtering Capabilities. Find the Photos You Love with just a few clicks!
* Zooming - Zoom Without overlapping the Photo itself. Compare Photos while Zooming - just move to a different Photo - Zooming continues.

We&#39;d like to know what you think:
* Is the design easy and straightforward enough?
* Are the any things you consider a &quot;must&quot; missing?
* Any bugs? :) 

*** ...but assuming the feedback is positive, we&#39;re thinking of porting this to Android/iOS/mac (this would come at a later time - probably 9-12 months from now).</description>
