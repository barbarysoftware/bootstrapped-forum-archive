    <description>Hi Everyone,

My name is Cem Hurturk and I&#39;m the co-founder of [Sendloop][1]. 

Sendloop is an easy-to-use email marketing service designed for SaaS owners, application developers and small to medium sized e-commerce sites.

Sendloop helps you to increase retention and engagement of your users by sending them very targeted emails.

Basically, it saves your time and development resources implementing &quot;event driven&quot; messages such as trial period message schedule, slipping away user re-engagement emails, getting started emails, etc.

I believe Sendloop and its smart event-driven messaging feature &quot;Sendloop Engage&quot; is a key solution for SaaS owners and helps them to keep their users engaged and active.

I&#39;m excited to be a part of this highly active community and looking forward to get enrolled in discussions.
