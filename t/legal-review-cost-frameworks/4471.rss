    <title>Legal Review Cost Frameworks</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/legal-review-cost-frameworks/4471</link>
    <description>For high-cost contractual negotiations with things such as governments, universities, hospitals, etc, how you recoup the costs caused by these discussions reliably? I&#39;m speaking of both attorney fees and management time and attention spent on the issues.

Long term higher rates for certain clients? 

Lower margins on institutional clients by just eating the costs? 

Fees for any/serious changes to the standard documents?

Start contract fees?</description>

            <p>I think this all depends on your market and product. For TheoremReach, most of our clients end up being in the 5k-40k+/mo repeat customers. So it’s pretty easy for us to build that into the cost of acquiring a customer while still maintaining great margins.</p>
