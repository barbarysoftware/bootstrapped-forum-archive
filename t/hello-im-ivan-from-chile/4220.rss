    <title>Hello, I&#39;m Ivan from Chile</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hello-im-ivan-from-chile/4220</link>
    <description>I just discovered the podcast and the forum after getting to joelonsoftware.com closed forum via Google.

We have a small studio with my wife who&#39;s digital artist and we were doing video games (Flash, iOS, Unity3d) previously, mostly for clients. Game development always was a tough industry due to its hit-driven nature but in the last years it became barely profitable for both client projects and independent ones.

I moved to app development and bootstrapped a time tracker for Mac that I always wanted – [Qbserve](https://qotoqot.com/qbserve/). It had a very successful launch on HN and PH, so now I&#39;m trying to make it my full time business.

Apps for Mac is not a very popular market, so I hope I can find some information here and share our experience.</description>

<p>I had no idea what that meant and it left me rather confused. After a while I guessed it meant automatic time tracking. But I don’t think that is the first thing you should see.</p>

<p>I hope we’ll soon remove it completely. Firefox support shouldn’t be hard – I’m just too short on time right now to write an extension for it.</p>

            <p>Ivan,</p>
<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>The very first thing I see when I go to your site is a pink bar saying:</p>
<p>“Qbserve does not support Firefox site tracking. We hope to fix it soon, sorry!”</p>
<p>I had no idea what that meant and it left me rather confused. After a while I guessed it meant automatic time tracking. But I don’t think that is the first thing you should see.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>Thank you, it’s “cube-serve” in our opinion. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Welcome, Ivan. Nice to see you here.</p>
<p>I downloaded and checked out Qbserve when it was on Hacker News. I was very impressed, even if I can’t work out how to pronounce it.</p>
<p>It is polished, complete, smooth and has an excellent UI, all qualities I struggle with in my own software. I hope this does soon become your full time business.</p>
