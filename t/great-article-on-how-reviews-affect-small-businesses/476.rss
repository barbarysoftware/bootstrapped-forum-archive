[**http://jayporter.com/dispatches/how-about-a-nice-game-of-chess/**][1]

This is an article by Jay Porter, a restaurant owner, on the effect that Yelp has on small businesses in general, restaurants in particular. 

&gt; &quot;... for these businesses to mature, over the years, into truly
&gt; compelling entities, they have do more than just not read their
&gt; reviews. They have to ignore the very framework of the review system
&gt; itself.&quot;

As Ian pointed out in his tweet, there are clear parallels here for those of us who try to make a living in the mobile market.
