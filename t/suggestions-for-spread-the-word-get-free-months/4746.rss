    <title>Suggestions for &quot;spread the word, get free months&quot;?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/suggestions-for-spread-the-word-get-free-months/4746</link>
    <description>There are two halves to my market:  healthcare professionals and their patients.

The professionals are an evergreen referral source. 
I&quot;m thinking of giving the professionals a free month. And, if the number of active professionals gets to 10, then everyone gets a second month. Thereafter every time it doubles, I add a free month. 

I can track that with the URL that gives them the free subscription.

**Any thoughts on how else to maximize this?**

I&#39;ll be sending out special emails (and offers for tours, etc.) to those free Pro subscribers.
I&#39;ll also let them know the best places to share their link.
I&#39;m considering including their email address in the referrer ( ?utm_campaign=MyEmail@name.com)  so I can find the folks who refer a lot.

Maybe offering some sort of intrinsic prize for the biggest referrer:
- Extra months
- Free personalized Tour
-Subscription to our other software.</description>

            <ol>
<li>The referral is only for  other therapists. So I don’t think that would be an issue. (And I do agree, and would not give professionals anything in exchange even for getting patients to even try it)</li>
<li>We will be giving those professionals a seperate voucher for a free  trial for patients. But the bigger issue is reaching professionals to begin with.</li>
<li>There’s no simple way (currently) to give them a free account for one patient.</li>
</ol>

            <p>For healthcare, I’d hesitate to give professionals a free month in exchange for a referral, as that can be seen as “buying” them.</p>
<p>Isn’t it possible to give the professionals a limited, unconditional free account, where they can treat one patient? (they’d have to pay for treating multiple patients).  If they like, they refer it.</p>
<p>And why don’t you give the professionals a free voucher/flyer (on paper), they can give to their patients with a code to track the professionals (and an offer for new customers).</p>
