    <title>Christian Fea bootstrapping Cannabis Banking Solutions</title>

    <description>Hello,

Thank you bootstrapped for giving a chance to introduce.

I am from Monarch Technologies, Inc. that is a Cannabis Banking Solutions (monarch.is) provider company.

Monarch was built after years of industry research from client frustration and misunderstanding of how to handle compliance, taxation, and payments in the Hemp/CBD industry. After analyzing and diagnosing the banking industry and practices, we identified the need to solve these issues with a compliance-driven SaaS platform.

The intention being to reduce the risks involved for Hemp/CBD business owners as well as for financial institutions to successfully underwrite, on-board and provide continued compliance and taxation services to farmers, growers, supply chain, distribution, wholesale, manufacturing and dispensary initiatives.</description>
