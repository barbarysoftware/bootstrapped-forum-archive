    <title>Hello all! Serial entrepreneur and coder by heart here</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hello-all-serial-entrepreneur-and-coder-by-heart-here/7354</link>
    <description>Hope everyone is doing well.  My name is Daniel and I&#39;ve been programming for the past 25 years or so.  A few years back my wife and I created a company (Smart Convos, Inc) which creates conversational marketing tools and solutions.

Being a coder most of my life I sometimes find it hard to transition into the business/marketing side of things, so I look forward to interesting discussions and learning more here.  Feel free to message me if you have any questions or need any help as well. :)</description>

<p>PS: I am a product manager by profession and an aspiring indie-hacker. Currently, am freelancing with couple startups by helping them with customer research.</p>
