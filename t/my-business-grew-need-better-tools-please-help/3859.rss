    <title>My business grew. Need better tools. Please help!</title>

    <description>My logo design company grew from tracking project status in an excel sheet, to setting up pipelines using StreakCRM and tracking the logo projects through their stages. (&quot;Received&quot;, &quot;in design&quot;, &quot;in review&quot;, &quot;completed&quot; type of thing).

As I&#39;m working with more and more companies that outsource their logo work to me, it&#39;s time for me to take the next growth step. I now need to know things like if it&#39;s a new or returning client, and have a way of seeing all their projects at a glance.... and also all email communication within the project (as that&#39;s what I currently have and really like with Streak).

Do any of you fine business owners know a tool that does this?

I&#39;ve looked into several CRM tools, but they all seem to be very sales-oriented. That&#39;s great, but irrelevant ATM. What I need is to manage my clients and have a good overview of their current and past projects.

Please help if you&#39;ve ran into something as your business grew, OR, if you think there&#39;s a better place I should ask my question - do please tell me where.</description>

            <p>Not the ideal solution, but I think Trello should be able to do a lot of what you need. You can create a separate board for each of the agencies you work with, and then handle all orders for their various end clients from within each board.</p>

            <p>Consider using even something like Jira. You can create an Epic for each customer and then keep track of their individual projects under individual tickets.</p>
<p>It’s a little outside the box, but my work. After I saw their blog post[1] about using Jira to keep track of Computer assets, it really opened my eyes to what it can do.</p>

<p>it would be better to be conscious of your direction. I don’t know the open source CRMs, google gives “<a href="http://www.fatfreecrm.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fatfreecrm.com/</a>” for “open source crm ruby”</p>

Do you know which CRMs are open source and customizable? Or at least where to find trustworthy ones?<br>
(I hope my ignorance isn’t too evident, heh).</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/alex_shaikevich">@Alex_Shaikevich</a>,<br>
I never used CRM systems, but I’m sure that there are many customizeable open-source ones. Are you a software developer? if yes then you can customize an open-source CRM for your own needs, add missing features</p>
