    <title>What tools do you use for technical writing?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/what-tools-do-you-use-for-technical-writing/2806</link>
    <description>Some of you have published technical courses or books that contain code snippets and inline code (class names, method signatures, etc.). I currently use Scrivener for this purpose, but its support for code is not ideal. I was therefore wondering what other tools make this easier. iBooks Author is another option I&#39;m aware of, but I haven&#39;t used it much yet.</description>

            <p>I used <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org">Sphinx</a> for my books. It’s not perfect, but it works really well with code snippets.<br>
I wrote a little bit about it here:</p>

and two PDF versions (black-and-white and color). Sphinx works quite...</p>

<p>No, you are not. I sell that book on Gumroad as well. Leanpub are not publishers, just distributors. Big difference. That means that, unlike traditional publishers, you retain full ownership of copyright.</p>
<p>With Leanpub, you don’t even have to publish with them. When I first started out, I used LeanPub to write the book, but then sold it via Gumroad. Only later on, when a few people asked, I published it on LeanPub as well.</p>
<p>LeanPub is quite good in that way- there is no need to use their publishing service. But I do it anyway, as I have had a few hundred dollars of sales from them, all without doing anything.</p>
<p>The only thing I hate about them is they take 45 days to pay you, while with Gumroad you get it within days/weeks. (Yes, I know why, but still. They could handle refunds the way everyone else does.)</p>

            <p>I used LeanPub for my <a href="https://leanpub.com/pythonforengineers" rel="nofollow noopener">book</a>.</p>
<p>They take your Markdown and automatically created pdf, epub and mobi files.</p>
<p>I use Scrivener for my fiction, but like you, found it not so great for programming. All the other tools I tried weren’t that great either. Leanpub takes a bit of getting used to, but they create great books once you understand how they work.</p>

            <p>If you want to go really heavy duty, DocBook is pretty good in a lot of ways, as it comes with an entire toolchain that you can use to mangl…process your documentation.</p>
<p>It is very heavy duty, though, with a steep learning curve.  I’m not sure it’s ideal for an agile/MVP/bootstrapped kind of thing unless you really know what you’re doing.</p>

            <p>I find that using markdown is far too limiting for the kind of things I write (mostly help files for my users). As <a class="mention" href="/u/allan_jardine">@allan_jardine</a> demonstrates having the power of XML allows for a far richer output which can help the user stay oriented and engaged. Being able to style certain phrases  or keywords in meaningful ways can accelerate the reader’s understanding of things. Having “tip” blocks “warning” blocks, or asides like they do in programming books is nice too.</p>
<p>Unfortunately writing straight-up XML isn’t much fun. For that reason I am currently scratching my own itch by creating a rich content editor. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>For my own API documentation (so not directly applicable to books, but another point of reference) I use a mix of Markdown (slightly customised for my needs) for general “discussion” text and XML for structured information - <a href="https://github.com/DataTables/DataTablesSrc/blob/master/docs/api/row().node().xml" rel="nofollow noopener">example file</a>. That way it is fairly trivial for me to generate HTML documentation pages - <a href="http://datatables.net/reference/api/row().node()" rel="nofollow noopener">example file rendered</a>.</p>
<p>That way I can continue to live in my beloved text editor <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> .</p>
<p>XML might not be “hot stuff” in the tech world anymore, but it does have some good uses, and its working well for me there so far!</p>

            <p>Some of you have published technical courses or books that contain code snippets and inline code (class names, method signatures, etc.).
