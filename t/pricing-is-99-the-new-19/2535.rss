    <title>Pricing: Is $99 the new $19?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/pricing-is-99-the-new-19/2535</link>
    <description>It may be my imagination but I think I&#39;m seeing $99/mo. more commonly now than $19/mo. as a baseline in SaaS World.

Has anybody else noticed this? (I like it.)</description>

            <p>It could be perception more than reality. Or maybe not.</p>
<p>I have noticed though that some of the pay-per-month services I’ve been using for years were much cheaper when I started using them. Two examples: GetSatisfaction and Vanilla Forums. They are both several times more expensive than when I started using them.</p>
<p>Perhaps they’ve learnt the wisdom of charging premium prices in their fields. 1,000 customers @ $100/month is a more pleasant business to run than 50,000 customers @ $10/month, even though the gross revenue is much lower.</p>
<p>Luckily in both cases I’m grandfathered on the cheaper, older plan.</p>

            <p>Isn’t the fact also that Microsoft, Adobe and all have gone to a subscription model now… so consumers of such services are getting used to pay for the value… There used to be a question with regards to reliability of such services but now nobody thinks twice about making the leap…</p>

            <p>I don’t think it’s as simple as increasing prices. Back in the day (aka BoS forum) there were a lot more people doing consumer apps and one time payments - Bingo Card Creator, Collectorz, Perfect Table Plan, Poker Copilot. Today there’s a lot more people doing business apps on monthly subscriptions.</p>

<p>While QE was in full power, it made sense. Now that QE has stopped, I’d expect it to go back to $19. (Same as oil).</p>

</aside>
<p>Just so I’m clear, QE is quantitative easing and you think that QE is responsible for 500% growth in SAAS prices?</p>
