    <title>Hello, I&#39;m Phil Anderson of BudgetSimple</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hello-im-phil-anderson-of-budgetsimple/69</link>
    <description>You may remember me from the good old days of Business of Software forums as the guy that had a business selling Chimney Sweep software (ChimSoft).  Although that was a terrible idea (it did have some sales and more or less broke even), I learned a ton of lessons from the experience.

I also created one of the first sites on the Internet for buying and selling used cars in 1995: [Used Cars On-Line][1] (I missed usedcars.com by a single month).  Believe it or not, that business still provides income to this day.

I&#39;m currently working on [BudgetSimple][2] which started bootstrapped, however I&#39;m currently going the fundraising route and recently took a $25k investment.  As someone who has done both funded and bootstrapped companies, I&#39;ve learned the pros and cons of both, but in general believe the primary purpose of starting a business is to turn a profit (which shouldn&#39;t have to be said, but these days....)

            <p>I remember reading your blog and having the feeling of how unfair it was that you busted your butt getting ChimSoft off the ground, fighting for every sale, and then a used car listing website, which was seemingly just a side thing for you, started making more revenue than the product you were hoping would be your flag-ship.</p>

            <p>Of course I remember! Great to have you back. I didn’t know (or forgot) about the used car site. That’s amazing it’s still going.</p>
<p>Sharing how BudgetSimple goes and especially how the investment process works I’m sure will be very interesting to everyone. Looking forward to it.</p>
