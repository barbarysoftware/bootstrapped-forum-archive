    <title>Early prototype feedback! PowerPoint on steroids (Cloud-based, better animation, analytics, send via email, delivery tracking, crm integration)</title>

    <description>Have been having some fun with a friend of mine building a web based presentation tool in React as a side project. We&#39;re using a cocktail of APIs (Send Grid, GA, Typeform) along with a few AWS services to create a tool that lets users make a presentation, send it to someone and track the analytics from the viewer. Ignore the bugs as I know there are many.

Feel free to check it out and try to create something :) app.sizle.io

If you want to know when we (finally) launch a full version you can get do that at www.sizle.io

Would love to discuss any thoughts or questions anyone has about a software product like this!</description>
