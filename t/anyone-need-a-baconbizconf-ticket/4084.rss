    <title>Anyone Need a BaconBizConf Ticket?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/anyone-need-a-baconbizconf-ticket/4084</link>
    <description>I bought one at the early bird price, but probably won&#39;t be able to make it due to some last-minute things that have come up. Since the event is limited to 65 people and is currently sold out, I feel bad taking up a spot if there are people hoping to go!
