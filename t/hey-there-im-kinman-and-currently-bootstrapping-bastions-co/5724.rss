    <description>Hey bootstrapped community! My name is Kinman and I&#39;m working towards bootstrapping my first product. I&#39;ve always dreamed of being an entrepreneur. I used to have a nice business in middle school selling sodas for twice what I was paying, until I got shut down by the school with a nasty talking-to and a district-wide memo. So I settled for a career in software development, where I currently reside, which has been a blast.

Needless to say, I&#39;m excited to join the community and look forward to learning from you guys.</description>
