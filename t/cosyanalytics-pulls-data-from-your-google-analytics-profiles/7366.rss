I&#39;ve banged simple analytics that pulls its data from Google Analytics, mostly because I don&#39;t have the nerve to jump on all the Google&#39;s sidebar menus.

PS. From Saturday till today I&#39;ve noticed a significant drop in traffic in one of my websites. Compared with the web hosting AwStats and the difference is astonishing. Could this be related with the Google infrastructure recently being down?</description>

            <p>Looks very good!  I’m wondering if people will pay for this.  I do know that there are a few Saas which email Google Analytics reports on a weekly/monthly basis.  Maybe something you could add quite easily.</p>
