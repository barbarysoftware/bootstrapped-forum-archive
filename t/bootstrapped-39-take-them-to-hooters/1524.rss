            <p>Thanks JT. Every now and then I do bounce around ideas for book topics, or blog posts, or conference talks, but for the time being, I don’t think there’s another book in me.</p>

</aside>
<p>What counts as profanity is different depending on where you are as well. Some of the words that in the UK are kind of used as a replacement for a “bad” swear word, are seen as far worse in the US for example. Even within the UK there are words used in common speech “up North” that are counted more as swear words down South.</p>
<p>Ultimately it comes down to knowing your audience and context - which is harder on a podcast than in a conference presentation.</p>

            <p>I agree that this all depends on context.</p>
<p>I’ve always felt that the “Ian and Andrey Show” was basically two guys catching up and we happen to be let in on the conversation. Naturally when two friends talk about stuff they are interested/passionate about there is going to be swearing. (At least there is with me.) And even then it’s not much in my opinion.</p>
<p>But at Microconf when <a class="mention" href="/u/ian">@ian</a> gave his presentation I don’t think he dropped a single F-Bomb, right? I think I would have noticed, because the context was different. And that’s despite the fact that it’s the same audience (literally the same audience for a large proportion of attendees).</p>
<p>I think that so long asa you’re aware of your audience and context and you filter yourself based on that you’re fine.</p>
<p>Now I wonder how self-conscious <a class="mention" href="/u/ian">@ian</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/andrey">@andrey</a> will be about swearing on the next one. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>In general, if there is swearing on a podcast I unsubscribe.  It adds zero value and only makes the person using the language as uneducated.  Some people seem to swear as part of their everyday talking.</p>
<p>I honestly can’t recall any swearing or inappropriate dialog in Bootstrapped.  One podcast I won’t listen to is the one from Anthony of DNSimple and Steven from Less Accounting.  Anthony is a class act, yet Steven is not…the two differing set of values cancels the other out.</p>
<p>If I can’t listen to a podcast while family is around (not that I do that), then it’s not a podcast worth listening to.</p>
<p>Anyway, I love Bootstrapped…keep it going.</p>

            <p>Funny story - I just got back from Railsconf. When the AV guy was setting me up we were chatting. He was saying that he’d never worked at a conference where people were dropping so many f-bombs. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Of course this was right after DHH gave a quite controversial keynote. People were riled up.</p>

            <p>FWIW, I’ve actually unsubscribed from a few podcasts due to the excessive swearing (when I feel it gets to the point that it becomes classless). However, I have never felt that way about the Bootstrapped Podcast. A little colorful language can be like salt to the meal, dumping it on isn’t always a good thing, but the right amount adds flavor. I wouldn’t worry about it and just keep on with business as usual.</p>

            <p>Swearing in front of your peers is fine in some contexts.</p>
<p>I can’t think of any context where swearing in front of customers (or potential customers) is a good idea.</p>

            <p>It depends entirely on context. I wouldn’t post a swear word on our business sites, there’s no upside there and plenty of downside. In our podcast where we’re talking to or more specific audience in a more personal way I think it’s more appropriate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is written swearing word a larger taboo because of the paper trail?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It’s cause we all love the corporate world, and would like to go back to it, first chance we get. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<p>It does lead to the question (sorry Im hijacking the thread): Is swearing bad for business? I used to swear a bit, but after similar criticism, started self censoring, till everything is PG12 now. Mainly because I’m not as brave (or rich) as Ian and Andrey.</p>
<p>Sometimes, swearing may be the best way to get the point across. Eg,</p>
<p>“Doing that will really mess up the servers. Dont do it.”</p>
<p>“Doing that will really fuck up the servers. Dont do it.”</p>
<p>Is there a good cause to speak in a PG12 mode, if one isn’t selling to corporate types?</p>

            <p>I’m ok with hosts expressing their emotions with swearing. One f-word worth 1000 pictures.</p>
<p>I wonder though why nobody… errr… <em>very few</em> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> people use f-words in this thread, or, more generally, this forum? Is written swearing word a larger taboo because of the paper trail? And vice versa, the hosts swear on the air because they can get away with it? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p>Maybe it is a cultural thing but I’d never even noticed any swearing! I think in general Brits tend to be less fussed about swear words.</p>

            <p>I think the term is pretty new also at least it’s wide acceptance. None of those types of people would go to Microconf anyway <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Guys, the end of the episode was hilarious! Loved that <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/ian">@ian</a>, it was awesome to talk with you in person at Microconf. Isn’t that weird to talk with so many people you never met before who know details of you life?</p>
<p>I was quite frustrated that “frumpy” <a class="mention" href="/u/andrey">@andrey</a> wasn’t there. When I knew Ian was giving a talk I just stupidly assumed Mr. Butov would be there as well… silly me… like if you were this strange duo entity.</p>
<p>I also want to add that I agree with Ian about the ebook idea. Either you both intended or not, you managed to build this growing audience who knows <a class="mention" href="/u/andrey">@andrey</a> has this freaking ability with mobile development (and act if it was no big deal). Why not capitalize on that?</p>
<p>You don’t need to write the book now… just make a landing page with a book title, small description, 3 price tiers (1X, 2.2X and 5X, right?) and pre-sale it with some kind of discount or something.</p>
<p>I wish <a class="mention" href="/u/andrey">@andrey</a> did that… but while I was writing that I realize it is not very <span class="mention">@andrey-ish</span>.</p>

            <p>Ian mentioned he was surprised there were no mentions of Growth Hackers/Growth Hacking at MicroConf…to my memory, that term has not been used in talks at any of the previous 4 MicroConfs. The term seems to be more aspired to in the high-growth/VC-backed startup sector.</p>
