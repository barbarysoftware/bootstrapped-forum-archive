    <title>Trapped in trademark fiasco, looking for new name</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/trapped-in-trademark-fiasco-looking-for-new-name/3551</link>
    <description>**Background:**
My current startup brand name seems to be overlapping with one of major company trademark name. I spent almost 4-5 months bootstrapping and running it. I talked to couple of advisers, all of them say, it&#39;s quite probable, I will have to give up my brand name and it&#39;s won&#39;t $$$ worth spending money fighting it. 
*Coming to point*, I am already starting to think about new product name. Having bad experience, with current name, I need some help of people here. I will really appreciate, if you can just throw some unique names around and i will try to make something out it. Thanks!!

**About startup:** 
It&#39;s #SaaS company, building webservices (aka apis, microservices), targeting retailers. So solution offering will be typical SaaS pricing model which is subscription model. ($x per month), including free plan. I can share some more hashtags, #SaaS, #Microserivices, #Commerce, #E-Commerce, #Simple. 
I am more leaning towards some unique name, whose domains &amp; trademarks will be available.
For example: recently I used Zapier. Names like this, don&#39;t run into trademark issues and better branding prospects.

I understand, it&#39;s my first post here, using this login. 

Thanks

            <p>Here’s a few tools you might find helpful to find a name:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.leandomainsearch.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Lean Domain Search</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.namemesh.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">NameMesh</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve also created three ideas here, if people want to suggest new ones (or upvote a suggestion): <a href="http://updwn.co/-K0tkqvJCVp0MS8sUOxN" rel="nofollow noopener">http://updwn.co/-K0tkqvJCVp0MS8sUOxN</a></p>
