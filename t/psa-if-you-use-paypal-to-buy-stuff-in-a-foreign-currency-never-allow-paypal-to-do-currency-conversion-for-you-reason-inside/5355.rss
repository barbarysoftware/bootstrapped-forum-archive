    <title>PSA: If you use PayPal to buy stuff in a foreign currency, NEVER allow PayPal to do currency conversion for you. (Reason inside)</title>

    <description>Hi fellow bootstrappers,

I recently realized that PayPal is - through a combination of fees hidden in the ToS and some ... err ... interesting UX design decisions pushing people towards handling currency conversions for them. 
The lucrative part is that PayPal charges 3-4% FX fee (compared to your CC that charges 0-2%). 

So next time you buy something online through PayPal in a foreign currency, make sure they do not handle the currency conversion for you. 

I&#39;ve written a longer, more detailed article about it, if you&#39;re interested in that: https://www.saasemailmarketing.net/articles/paypal-ripoff/

P.S. I&#39;d appreciate any shares of that article</description>

            <p>Hey Kohan,</p>
<p>I’m definitely no expert on this, but here’s a link comparing a number of cards - all with 0% FX fee: <a href="https://www.finder.com.au/foreign-currency-international-fees-for-credit-cards" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.finder.com.au/foreign-currency-international-fees-for-credit-cards</a></p>
<p>Also, PayPal charges 3.5 - 4% FX fee in Australia, so you’d still (on average) safe some money with your current cards.</p>
<p>That being said, you’re right and you should check whether the advice applies to your specific situation.</p>

</aside>
<p>Depends on where you are and your credit card.  Here in Australia, my credit cards charge a 3% - 3.5% foreign transaction fee.  The only exception is American Express if the merchant agrees to quote a price in Australian Dollars (like Amazon will do), and then there is 0% forex fee.</p>
<p>So I’d definitely encourage being skeptical and doing the maths, but there can be cases where Paypal is actually providing a service and cheaper rates.</p>

            <p>Setting up different currency accounts in PP is one of the best moves I did. Not only can you charge people in their local currency, upping conversion rates, but you also pay for stuff in that currency without a conversion fee.</p>
<p>But obviously you still have to pay a conversion fee when/if you want to bring the money “back home”!</p>

            <p>Transferwise is the best thing happened to the bankless money management since Payoneer.</p>
<p>Totally recommended, it’s a lifesaver for me because local banks stuck in the 90s.</p>

            <p>Hi fellow bootstrappers,</p>
<p>I recently realized that PayPal is - through a combination of fees hidden in the ToS and some … err … interesting UX design decisions pushing people towards handling currency conversions for them.<br>
The lucrative part is that PayPal charges 3-4% FX fee (compared to your CC that charges 0-2%).</p>
<p>So next time you buy something online through PayPal in a foreign currency, make sure they do not handle the currency conversion for you.</p>
<p>I’ve written a longer, more detailed article about it, if you’re interested in that: <a href="https://www.saasemailmarketing.net/articles/paypal-ripoff/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.saasemailmarketing.net/articles/paypal-ripoff/</a></p>
<p>P.S. I’d appreciate any shares of that article</p>
