    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Derek Clark from 30 South</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-derek-clark-from-30-south/265</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a software developer originally from Ohio but now living in Nashville, TN for the last 6 years. I quit my day job a little over 2 years ago to run a mobile app business and do a bit of freelancing. I&#39;ve enjoyed making apps and it has gone well, but I&#39;m currently looking to move into a B2B SaaS business. Something about having an ARPU greater than 70 cents is enticing :-)
