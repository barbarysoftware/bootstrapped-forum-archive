            <p>So far so good. I think it ties in with the idea that we’re trying to keep it simpler than other tools so the pricing is simpler. I could see down the road if we add some more advanced features that we’d break that into tiers but for now it’s good.</p>
<p>As it’s per user it a bit different than other types of SaaS models. There’s an element of tiering built in even though it’s only one price as a company with 5 people pays 5X so it’s not exactly the same as if we were a project management app that only had 1 tier all unlimited.</p>

            <p>What’s your experience with having only one price on snappy? Do you “feel” you’re converting/performing better than if you went with a tiered pricing?</p>
