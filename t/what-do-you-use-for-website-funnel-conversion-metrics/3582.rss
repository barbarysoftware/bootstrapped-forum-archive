    <title>What do you use for website Funnel Conversion metrics?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/what-do-you-use-for-website-funnel-conversion-metrics/3582</link>
    <description>
I used Mixpanel for our new product and it worked well. It&#39;s free for a fairly low traffic website.
If you use Google Analytics, I&#39;d love to know whether you can get good Funnel Conversion metrics (for each step of your funnel)

I am now updating our &quot;old&quot; product line website and thought &quot;hey, I&#39;ll use Google Analytics&quot;.
But I&#39;ve always found the Reporting to be inscrutable. And I can&#39;t wrap my head around it. I look at part of a report and think &quot;OK, that would mean I should see ABC in another report&quot; and then I see something very different. And I get no answers when I post things like the conflicting [results like this][1]: 

I just want to make sure that I&#39;ve given Google Analytics a &quot;fair shake&quot;. (I don&#39;t even know why I&#39;m going to that trouble :smile:

            <p>Kissmetrics here as well - their onboarding was quite an amazing experience. Two calls (1x1h and 1x15m) to walk through their software using my account - was worth it just to be on the receiving side of onboarding!</p>
<p>Been using it for a couple of months now and quite impressed with it.</p>

            <p>NO, no reason.<br>
I just thought “I’m being dense if I can’t figure out GA. So I’ll try. I did, It sucks. Moving on to Mixpanel”</p>

            <p>Is there a reason you’re not using Mix Panel on the old product line? I thought it provided funnel conversation metrics?</p>
<p>Agree that Google Analytics is junk unless you’re prepared to invest an awful lot of time and energy in to it.</p>

            <p>Ugh, my old company launched a product that did exactly what you’re looking for. Unfortunately there wasn’t enough demand (or we weren’t marketing it right) and it was shut down just a few months ago.</p>
<p>Instead, check out HotJar or HeapAnalytics.</p>

            <p>I use <a href="http://kissmetrics.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Kissmetrics</a>, but it’s not free.  Very easy to read funnel analytics with good visualizations.  In this case, you get what you pay for.  I don’t think GA does a good job with funnels at all, IMO.  Too inscrutable for the busy person.</p>
