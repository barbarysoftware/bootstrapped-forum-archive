    <title>What were your wins in June?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/what-were-your-wins-in-june/3261</link>
    <description>Inspired by the &quot;[Celebrations][1]&quot; discussion maybe we should start to share our wins (and not fails?) here with each other? Anybody interested? 

For me June was the first month were my business earned me a higher salary than my last full time gig in 2013. I would like to attribute this to me overcoming the &#39;I don&#39;t like marketing&#39; hurdle and doing active marketing for the last 2 months. But of course it could just be luck... We&#39;ll nice thing about desktop applications is that I can start with 0,- in revenue again every month. Yea!

How about you guys?

            <p>We launched a huge new release of our scheduling software, Appointlet (<a href="https://www.appointlet.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.appointlet.com/</a>).</p>
<p>New designs for our landers and application, as well as a ton of new features.  This had been in the works for much longer than I would like to admit (ahh, scope creep), so it feels ridiculously good to have it out the door.</p>

            <p>Seems silly to start a new topic for July just 4 days into the month, so:</p>
<p>After 2 years of on and off work, I have submitted my first app to the App Store.  Now the hard work begins.  Will post more as time allows (really bad timing for me personally for launching a product, but that’s life).</p>

            <p>Daniel,<br>
Good idea. Congrats on your earnings too.</p>
<p>Here goes mine: This month, I launched my first app. It is a hosted static blog generator so that your gains speed and security and your gain convenience (it works with existing blog editors, at least it works with MarsEdit &amp; ScribeFire). I was thrilled when Bryson from <a href="http://goappschool.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://goappschool.com</a> interviewed me chatting about the backstory of the product. That was a cool day for me in June. (The interview is getting transcribed. He will release on July 13th).</p>
<p>My app lives at <a href="http://olai.in" rel="nofollow noopener">http://olai.in</a>. Hopefully I keep coming back every month to celebrate.<br>
Cheers,<br>
Joseph</p>
