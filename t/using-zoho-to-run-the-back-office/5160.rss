    <title>Using zoho to run the &#39;back office&#39;</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/using-zoho-to-run-the-back-office/5160</link>
    <description>Does anyone have experience of using Zoho to run their saas back office functions, e.g. subscription billing, accounting and help desk? Having had experience of using multiple services to provide these functions in the past and then having the nightmare of trying to integrate them I&#39;m looking for an all-in-one solution. Zoho looks promising but I&#39;m interested in real world reports...

Thanks!</description>
