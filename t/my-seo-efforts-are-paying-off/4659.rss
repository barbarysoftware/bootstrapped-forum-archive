    <title>My SEO efforts are paying off</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/my-seo-efforts-are-paying-off/4659</link>
    <description>There&#39;s recently been a couple of  content marketing discussions on this forum. Here&#39;s a chart showing how my website traffic has been growing while I&#39;ve been regularly attending to SEO, primarily through better content and focussed content:

![|489x395](upload://4fO6OiviXycGsiGjvSGeZupIPYM.png)  

Notes:

* Before the chart&#39;s time period, my traffic was flat for a couple of years.
* The Facebook ad campaign sent lots of traffic and resulted in plenty of downloads but led to no discernible sales increases
* Getting a link from a Patrick McKenzie article puts one&#39;s analytics out of whack for a while!
* The y-axis starts at zero. Which means, yes, my traffic has doubled in a year (comparing with the point annotated &quot;separated blog from website tracking&quot;. Sales have gone up significantly too, although they haven&#39;t increased at the same rate.
* The usual warning about confusing correlation and causation applies. And yes, I have done other things that may have helped with traffic. The beginning of the chart coincides with releasing a Windows port of what used to be just a Mac product.
* The total market for my product category is shrinking, so I&#39;m not getting any &quot;rising tide lifts all ships&quot; benefit.

Feel free to ask questions about what worked, what didn&#39;t, where to start, etc.</description>

            <p>I hear you on the supposed benefits of the “Long Tail” traffic.</p>
<p>However, one thought is that if you can find something very pertinent to your product that you can rank <span class="hashtag">#1</span> for, even if it’s only a little traffic every month, there might be a good payoff.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before I did that with an article recently.  Google showed it had almost no traffic (something like  “under 10 per day” (indicating almost not measurable).  But we are <span class="hashtag">#1</span> for that and it’s highly targeted (one of our programs is based on that keyword, so it’s a good tie in).</p>
<p>And the beauty is that the Tipping Effect (winner takes all) is very much to your benefit. It’s very hard to dislodge the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> page if it’s been there for a while. (I know, I tried this on one keyword. It took me a year of concerted effort to do this ONCE (and that was just moving from <span class="hashtag">#3</span> to <span class="hashtag">#1</span>).</p>

<p>for one of my products, I have ruled the number one spot in Google for several of the popular keywords on the topic…but my overall clicks have been going down.

</aside>
<p>That’s not good. Sorry to hear that. A benefit of Google not accepting my ads is that they don’t accept ads from my competitors either. So my most important keywords are either ad-free or low on ads.</p>
<p>Recently I noticed one of our affiliates running Google ads on exact name searches for our product. His ad sends people to our website with his affiliate link. I’m surprised he was able to get the ad accepted, so instead of asking him to stop this shady technique, I’m watching to see how long Google lets him do this.</p>

<p>Just a related comment here - for one of my products, I have ruled the number one spot in Google for several of the popular keywords on the topic…but my overall clicks have been going down. The cause seems to be that Google is stacking more and more paid ads on top of the organic results, so my Number “1” listing is actually more like Number “5”…It seems that I have to pay up for the top spot now, or go for the long tail clicks…unfortunately, those long tail clicks have been miniscual (sp?) compared to the popular keywords.</p>

            <p>After I wrote this I thought : ya’ know, I’m trying more focused this year. So I pick a goal and just work on solutions to THAT goal for a few months.  So maybe you should file away my suggestions for when you are working on increasing conversions to yoru newsletter.</p>
<p>How about if you tell them the first 2 or 3 BENEFITS they’ll get from the newsletter.</p>
<p>And how about if you provide tips that are focused on THEIR needs that just happen to involve PC?</p>
<p>Your first articles will be on</p>
<ol>
<li>The top mistake new  (and even experienced players) may, and how Poker Copilot can help.<br>
(I’m guessing there might be some examples of where human intuition about odds does not match up about true odds.)</li>

<p>I do this already. I set it up years ago, with what was then called an “auto-responder series”. The kids today seem to call it a “drip campaign”. TomAYto tomAHto.</p>

<p>This works pretty well. Maybe 20% of people who download sign up for the newsletter.</p>

<p>That’s probably 2 hours of work plus time to write those articles.</p>
<p>But the beauty is you are now collecting those emailis. You’ll thank yourself (or me <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> in 6 months when you DO get around to the newsletter.</p>
<p>Then see what it looks like after a few months. If you aren’t getting signups, then maybe it’s not worth more effort.</p>
<p>BTW, the way I do our newsletter now is that it’s just a quick announcement of new blog entries. So there is very little time need to “craft” the emails. In fact, plain text (in appearance) is probably better as it seems more personal and “folksy”</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/stevemcleod">@SteveMcLeod</a> the standalone video page is a great idea, I may steal that idea.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/serge">@Serge</a> Vimeo gives me better control over the video format and api than Youtube does. I was doing some stuff with video events that was much easier with Vimeo than Youtube. The Vimeo videos show up in google search results. I don’t imagine my target audience would be searching in Youtube for what I offer.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t have a well-thought out strategy here. I guess the blog posts are brief updates, and ephemeral stream-of-consciousness thinking. The articles are long-form content. More than anything, the blog section is to show evidence that this is an active, supported product. My biggest competitors have blogs that have not been updated in years. Perhaps, though, it is time to de-emphasise the blog in my page structure.</p>

I do a newsletter, but I could improve this dramatically. It is erratic in timing, content, and quality. So many things, so little time!</p>

<p>Yes, just a semantic difference. I was thinking of “blogging” in the older sense of a frequently-updated personal web log. But your blog example is identical to the concept of my articles.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see an A/B test between the same article with a heavy focus on your product “How to use Poker Copilot to play the odds better” and a softer approach where you start with the goal  “How to play the Odds in Poker” and then have more of a soft sell.</p>

<p>Any ideas on why the blog stopped working? Seems like articles and blog would be the same thing (except that you have blog on a sub domain).  This is an example of a recent blog post on my site, <a href="https://pageproofer.com/blog/step-away-from-your-spreadsheet-get-a-visual-bug-tracker" rel="nofollow noopener">https://pageproofer.com/blog/step-away-from-your-spreadsheet-get-a-visual-bug-tracker</a> , the goal is to push for a trial conversion. Maybe blog and article difference is just semantic.</p>

<p>Do you have any tips for finding a content writer?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ah, that’s a hard question. I got lucky - I kept my eyes and ears open and didn’t rush. Eventually someone posted on the poker subreddit that he had just finished writing some poker content for a client, and linked to the content. It was exactly the style I was looking for so I contacted him directly to see if he was available. By chance, he was, and we were able to negotiate a fair price.</p>
<p>I think <a class="mention" href="/u/polimorfico">@polimorfico</a> has found some excellent content writers for <a href="https://quaderno.io/blog/">https://quaderno.io/blog/</a> - perhaps he can give some tips on this.</p>

<p>I’m curious about the types of blog content and strategies you are using.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>First, I’m not doing this as blog content. My blog seemed to stop working around 2012 as an effective way to communicate with my customers and prospects. Instead I’m adding articles to my main website.</p>
<p>In my calender, <strong>I mark every Monday as <a href="http://www.singlefounder.com/6-steps-for-implementing-marketing-monday/">Marketing Monday</a></strong> (I picked up this discipline from <a class="mention" href="/u/jitbit">@jitbit</a>’s <a href="http://Microconf.eu">Microconf.eu</a> talk in 2015, who in turn acknowledges Mike Taber). I have a checklist of tasks to work through each Monday, which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>either <strong>writing new content or touching up existing content</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>checking the analytics</strong> (I mostly use Google Search Console for this) for content that is ranking unexpectedly well, or is getting way more impressions than other new content. This supplies new content ideas. (I also use this step to find content to discard.)</li>
<li>
<strong>read a blog post or guide to SEO</strong>. This gets repetitive, but that helps cement the knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>My content approach for the first few months of the year was scattershot, as I didn’t really know what I was doing and had to feel my way. I figured writing any content was better than writing none. After doing that for a while, I got a sense of what worked.</p>
<p>Two specific strategies have worked well:</p>
<ul>
<li>copying <a class="mention" href="/u/andy">@Andy</a>’s  <strong>targeted landing page</strong> approach (“Perfect Table Plan for &lt;insert highly specific category&gt;”). Whereas I’ve been unable to get into the top 3 Google results for my preferred keyword, with this approach I own position 1 in Google results for several specific phrases.</li>
<li>
<a class="mention" href="/u/clay_nichols">@Clay_Nichols</a>’ observation that whereas I had been writing about me (“Poker Copilot is great because…”) I should instead <strong>write about what my potential audience wants</strong> (“Improve your poker game with these techniques…”). This seems so obvious in hindsight, but was an eye-opener.</li>
</ul>
<p>One final step:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Finding the right content writer</strong>. When I realised that high quality content for my audience works, I spent some months looking for a subject matter expert who could write some content for me. I’ve now found such a person, and he is supplying me with content whose quality is way above anything I could write on the subject.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Definitely, although the sales increase was not as great as the traffic increase. I guess that’s because whereas I used to mostly get traffic from people searching directly for my rather specific product category (“poker tracking software for mac”) I now get substantial traffic from non-direct searches (“essential poker statistics”).</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m curious about the types of blog content and strategies you are using. In my research there seem to be three approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>random posts that are specific to the product and/or market, large gaps of time with no posts</li>
<li>plentiful planned, regular posts that are more about the focus market, but very generic and mostly click bait, ie top 10 lists, top 5 fav tools etc, nothing that really ties product to market</li>
<li>planned posts at regular intervals that are focus market specific and relate back to product offering but are not as frequent, only a few per month</li>
</ol>
<p>1 is really no strategy just haphazard, 2 is the shot gun approach that I suspect most low level SEO and content marketing firms pump out, 3 seems to be the right mix but it requires patience for things to build up.</p>
<p>I tried <span class="hashtag">#1</span> for the longest time because I would rather spend time building the product and features than writing blog posts. In hind sight that was a losing strategy. I have since moved to <span class="hashtag">#3</span> as it seems the more effective path to getting long term SEO and content success. I keyed in our a few phrases that all competitors in my focus market were after and focused posts and content around those terms. The results have been very positive, I went from page 5 and further back on the two most critical search terms in google to page 1 within 6 weeks and page 3 with the other. Monthly traffic has more than doubled over 4 months and signups trial/paid have followed suit. The challenge I see is continuing to come up with fresh content ideas that I can slowly churn out over time.</p>

            <p>Small tweaks … hmmm… Actually, I want to re-structure it and mostly organize it so I can benefit from the trafic… I have nothing to loose I guess as it is a loss right now… I guess you have to live dangerously if you want to stay on the edge with google Steve… lol</p>
<p>I can appreciate the amount of work that goes into a steady climb like you did… Its funny, new year so I am making an inventory of the assets I have… I even have a car repair video with 1.3 million views on Youtube… lol Stuff you abandon that if you had stuck with it you might have done well…</p>
<p>I like Youtube as a SEO magnet… you can get a lot of traffic from a good video… but then you have to do something with the traffic… silly me… lol</p>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="rQhG6dyX_AI" data-youtube-title="Proper automotive rust repair" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>
<p>lol …</p>
<p>I wonder in English… would be a lot of work to redo…</p>
