    <title>Co-founder as a service? Has this been done before?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/co-founder-as-a-service-has-this-been-done-before/5609</link>
    <description>Has anyone seen such a model being offered before? 

&gt; Strategic consulting &amp; MVP development on a fixed costs basis &amp; small equity (where applicable). Not outsourced. Time and materials with milestone deliverables.

My thinking is that this would be something targeting people who have too little experience to talk to a software house and are likely moonlighting in idea stage. The big risk I see here is expectation managment and goal alignments.

Is this a good track for a one-man consulting business?
I would love to see examples of this being done before and hear your thoughts.</description>

            <p>I think that “co-founder” implies staying on the project for years. Just helping with MVP development and strategy is closer to a regular consultation.</p>
