    <title>How to find people within your target audience to interview?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-to-find-people-within-your-target-audience-to-interview/4456</link>
    <description>We&#39;re in a very early stage of our startup and are looking into validating some of the problems we want to solve. For this we want to run a lot of interviews with people from our target audience (we&#39;re using the Lean Startup method).

The problem is that it&#39;s hard to get people to have a 30 minute interview. We&#39;ve got 30+ subscribers to our beta waiting list and I`ve tried my own network.

The issue might be that most are very busy and find it hard to make time for this.

The audience is B2B, digital marketing consultants and freelancers working for multiple clients and mostly active in lead generation.

We know there&#39;s a interest in our ideas as the responses we got via Betalist.com and other sources are all extremely positive and the few people we&#39;ve interviewed where very interested and confirmed our ideas.

Any ideas on how to continue?</description>

            <p>so the lead value is of the same leads that were sent by the lead generation firm? essentially, revenue attribution?</p>

            <p>It’s a problem that digital marketing managers/consultants that work a lot with clients for lead generation might have:</p>
<p>Combining advertising cost and campaign data with real lead value data from a clients’ CRM. Generally campaign optimization and/or evaluation happens with pre-determined lead value which is often based on an average. This disregards the real value of leads and might give a skewed ROI per campaign. Especially as certain campaigns might generate higher value leads than others.</p>
<p>Additionally people who combine this data often do this once a month, manually, which is time consuming.</p>

            <p>The thing is, that’s exactly what we want to do. We want to talk with marketers to understand how they perceive this particular problem and, if it’s a big enough problem, how we can fit our solution within their day-to-day workflow.</p>

            <p>Agreed.  I think when trying to get a customer to talk to you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Offer SOMETHING of value. Ideally “hey, this is a simple, rough version, but it does SOMETHING for you”</li>
<li>Make it clear you want to hear what THEY think</li>
</ol>

            <p>I no longer do customer interviews related to my niche (growth for hiring software engineers). It’s a distraction, and unless I’m speaking to someone I know will take my advice, it feels like a big drain. I would only do customer interviews related to problems/solutions that I personally have, and want the person asking me questions to solve. So if they come in saying “help me ideate!!1” that’s an interview I’d turn down. If they’re saying “help me refine my sales/marketing-related SaaS” then sure I’ll give you tons of advice.</p>
<p>Update: Try doing a sales safari, much of the customer development information you need is probably already online.</p>

            <p>Yep, perhaps you could get the API key and then just pull out the data somewhat manually with a simple program that puts it into a spreadsheet for you and then you make the graphs/displays you would show them.</p>
<p>I’m guessing that for just the 5-10 interviews that might take you  just a few hours to set up the extraction (to spreadsheet) and then maybe an hour per interview. That’s maybe 15 hours of work and you get:</p>
<ol>
<li>An MVP</li>
<li>An actual valuable deliverable, so the discussion is “hey want to see some cool dashboards on your product?” instead of “sit through a sales pitch:” ( I think it’s NOT a sales pitch but they don’t know that.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another suggestion for GETTING leads.<br>
How about if you had some mockups where they look at them and try to figure out what the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> thing they should be working on it. The thing that will move the needle the most for the least effort.</p>

            <p>After giving it some consideration we’re probably going to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep on searching for people to interview using some of your suggestions to increase our success</li>
<li>Start working on a super basic MVP. Probably without any reporting and dashboards so we`ll can do that part manually and work with early customers to create reporting that fits perfectly in their workflow. This could serve as a proof of concept and customer data would be secure.</li>
</ol>

<p>No, doing this manually won’t be possible as we would need data from all sources, and this would mean that customers would need to give us the raw data. It would make more sense to create a simple MVP. It might be an idea to focus on a very specific workflow first and built a basic product around that.</p>

<p>Sorry, it is not clear to me – is it hard to find those people, or you find them just fine, but they are not willing to be interviewed?</p>
<p>Simple – pay them for their time at their going rate.</p>

</aside>
<p>I a bit of both I<code>m afraid. Paying their regular rate is an option but I</code>m wondering whether this wouldn’t bias them in some way as they might feel pushed to give certain answers because I pay them</p>

<p>Are the interviews more for validation or trying to discover what to build or how to build it? Until people are invested in your platform, their motivation to interview is going to be limited. Once you have playing customers actively using it, then interviews are much easier to come by. Alternatively, instead of pitching it as interviews, what if you did “Demos” for people to show them how you could help? You’ll still end up hearing feedback and getting ideas, but the focus is more on what your software can do for them than the insights they could give you.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The interviews are for validating our idea without leading the customers.<br>
So to understand that if the problem we’re seeing is really a recurring problem for the target audience. To see if it’s a big enough problem and to understand how they perceive and currently solve this issue. I.e. if they currently don’t solve it it might not be as big of a problem as we think.</p>
<p>Secondary interviews will help us understand how to create a solution that works well for the client and fits within their workflows.</p>
<p>So at this stage building a simple MVP would defy the purposes of the interviews. Once we have a product it might be that we have to redo it completely based on interview outcomes.  Also already having a basic product might heavily bias us in interpreting interview results as we`d want our product to be the best solution. … but maybe it’s our best option.</p>

<p>Is there a way for you to MANUALLY do this for some customers?<br>
That’s a great starting point to make sure you re targeting the right features before you begin.</p>
<p>30 minutes is a a bit commitment considering they don’t know you, and have now idea whether they’d get anything out of it.</p>
<p>Let’s assume you meant you can get them to respond but not commit to such a long interview.<br>
Suggestions</p>
<p>Pay them<br>
Do a shorter interviewer<br>
Have an actual deliverable (do it manually if necessary)</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, doing this manually won’t be possible as we would need data from all sources, and this would mean that customers would need to give us the raw data. It would make more sense to create a simple MVP. It might be an idea to focus on a very specific workflow first and built a basic product around that.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes that’s what we wanted to use the interviews for, get a great understanding of the client and their workflow and iterate the product from there based on client feedback.<br>
Sadly doing it manually won’t work,</p>
<p>But still I would love to speak to more people first.</p>

            <p>There was something I couldn’t quite get right in my thoughts or articulate earlier, but <a class="mention" href="/u/clay_nichols">@Clay_Nichols</a> response helped. It’s somewhat about doing the process manually. You have to do it manually and get in and help people do something. By virtue of doing the process manually and helping them, the rest becomes an almost unavoidable side effect. You build a business/app/product once the amount of people asking you to do that thing overwhelm the number of hours you have available to help them.</p>
<p>Then, the business is really just a framework that enables you to handle the requests you’re receiving. Derek Sivers says it great in his post <a href="https://sivers.org/asking" rel="nofollow noopener">“Don’t start a business until people are asking you to.”</a> Don’t build something and then ask people how to improve it. Help people in person, and let that guide and inform how you build it.</p>

            <p>Are the interviews more for validation or trying to discover what to build or how to build it? Until people are invested in your platform, their motivation to interview is going to be limited. Once you have playing customers actively using it, then interviews are much easier to come by. Alternatively, instead of pitching it as interviews, what if you did “Demos” for people to show them how you could help? You’ll still end up hearing feedback and getting ideas, but the focus is more on what your software can do for them than the insights they could give you.</p>
<p>Assuming that your current interviews are more for validation, I’d suggest nothing is more powerful than launching something, no matter how small it seems, that solves the pain well enough to get people to put in credit card information. That’s the best validation. If that seems difficult or you don’t feel like you’re at a point that the product could justify credit card information, then I’d say a good step would be to do what you can to get it to that point.</p>
<p>Looking at your site in the other thread, you’re doing a good job focusing on the customer’s pain in the copy and the points you have. I’d say I’m pretty well in your target audience, and for me, my instinct for any kinds of promises like this are “there’s no way this can possibly work or be accurate.” That’s not a slight on your software, but rather I know how disjointed all of these tools are.</p>
<p>I’m only one data point of course, but having some information to show how it really works could go a long ways. There’s a lot of great promises on there, but it’s hard to believe that a lot of them are even possible given the state of the other apps and how they handle things.</p>
<p>The last minor detail is that “Sign Up” might be a little overaggressive in this context. Maybe “Join our Beta List” with an estimated timeframe that you hope to launch could help on that front.</p>

            <p>We’re in a very early stage of our startup and are looking into validating some of the problems we want to solve. For this we want to run a lot of interviews with people from our target audience (we’re using the Lean Startup method).</p>
<p>The problem is that it’s hard to get people to have a 30 minute interview. We’ve got 30+ subscribers to our beta waiting list and I`ve tried my own network.</p>
<p>The issue might be that most are very busy and find it hard to make time for this.</p>
<p>The audience is B2B, digital marketing consultants and freelancers working for multiple clients and mostly active in lead generation.</p>
<p>We know there’s a interest in our ideas as the responses we got via <a href="http://Betalist.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Betalist.com</a> and other sources are all extremely positive and the few people we’ve interviewed where very interested and confirmed our ideas.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to continue?</p>
