@SteveMcLeod have you seen this?

Do you see this as
- A threat - potential customers may be more wary
- An opportunity - you can say - &quot;were legit - we sell these products and earn money that way, not from spying on you&quot;
- A non-story that will just vanish

*(Also - Let me know if you want this thread deleted).*</description>

            <p>I hadn’t heard of this one. It is very interesting.</p>
<p>When I announced in 2008 that I was creating poker software, Patrick McKenzie wrote this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m interested in seeing how Steve plans to promote something cleanly in an online field saturated with scum and villainy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is right - an online activity that involves winning and losing money attracts plenty of crooks.</p>
<p>I’m not too worried about this specific story. The dominant online poker room, PokerStars, has a competent, well-resourced security team that deals with these issues quickly. They release software updates every week or so.</p>
<p>This story certainly doesn’t compare to April 15, 2011 (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Scheinberg">online poker’s Black Friday</a>),when my monthly sales dropped by 55%, and never fully recovered.</p>
