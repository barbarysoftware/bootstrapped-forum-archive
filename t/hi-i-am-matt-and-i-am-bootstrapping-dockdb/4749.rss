    <title>Hi I am Matt and I am bootstrapping DockDB</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-i-am-matt-and-i-am-bootstrapping-dockdb/4749</link>
    <description>Hi My name is Matt, I come from a small city in Ireland.
I just graduated a few days ago from my college :slight_smile: 
I have been working on this product while I was in my final semester.

The product I am bootstrapping is [DockDB](https://dockdb.com). It&#39;s an easy to run PhpMyAdmin.

**Use Case:**
To see if your newly coded signup form worked and may be to tweak the data a little here and there.

Our primary idea is to be a light weight tool for developers/hackers.

I would really appreciate if I could get any feedback :slight_smile:</description>

            <p>My friend made this, <a href="https://github.com/bobthecow/genghis" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/bobthecow/genghis</a>, maybe he never tried to charge so it didn’t make money, but for whatever reason it looks like he doesn’t currently work on it. Does phpmyadmin make money?</p>
<p>hmm… navicat sponsors phpmyadmin and sells <a href="https://www.navicat.com/store/navicat-for-mysql" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.navicat.com/store/navicat-for-mysql</a> for 20,100,260.</p>
