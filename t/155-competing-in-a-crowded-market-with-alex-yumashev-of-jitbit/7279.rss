            <p>Alex’s blog is quite interesting. Articles are short and to the point, and it’s a real personal blog for other guys like us, not done for SEO purposes. Recommended:</p>

<p>Those are from MicroConf in the USA. MicroConf Europe, where Alex spoke that year, was not recorded unfortunately.</p>
<p>Luckily there were some excellent talks in the USA version!</p>

            <p>I don’t think the talks from MicroConf Europe in 2015 were ever made available online. Perhaps they weren’t recorded.</p>
<p>I’ve just asked Rob Walling. Will let you know when I find out.</p>
