    <description>Hey everyone!

Like to ski?  Like MicroConf discussions?  We have the perfect match for you...Big Snow Tiny Conf East and West, the just-right-mix of skiing and mastermind-style hallway track discussions you have at your favorite conferences!  Myself, @casjam, and @bradt are excited to be announcing our 6th and 3rd years respectively!

It&#39;s getting to be that time of year again--Registration will open shortly, so if you want to be on the &quot;early access&quot; list, you should sign up here (for West, held in Beaver Creek, Colorado, Feb 5-8, 2018):
https://bigsnowtinyconfwest.com/signup/

And here (for East, held in Sugarbush, Vermont--January 22-25, 2018):
https://east.bigsnowtinyconf.com/ (scroll to the bottom)

(Yes, the info on the site is currently out of date for East--@bradt is on it and will update soon)

Announcements will go out to these lists on October 2, so make sure you&#39;re on one if you&#39;d like to attend!

Hope to see you there.

            <p>Great concept and a great conference. We held the first annual European version last year and it was a ton of fun.  This year we’re doing the 2nd annual BSTC Europe in Avoriaz, France on February 5-8.</p>
<p>Great chance to get together with fellow bootstrapped founders, talk some shop, do some skiing, and enjoy a few days together with a few of your new best business friends.</p>
<p>Even if you can’t make one of the events I highly suggest this type of thing for everyone.  SO different than the bigger conferences, and a great compliment to other events you might have planned.</p>
