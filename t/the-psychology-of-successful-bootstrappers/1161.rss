            <p>I think you (bootstrappers in general, not you in particular) need to develop a thick skin. The first time someone asked for a refund I took it personally. Now I don’t bat an eyelid.</p>

            <p>What I find interesting is I’ve become WAY less neurotic by being a bootstrapper.</p>
<p>Before if I shipped code I went into neurotic overdrive worrying about if people liked it or if I did a feature right.  Almost paralyzed me sometimes and I just wouldn’t allow my work to be seen by the outside world.</p>
<p>Now I take great pleasure in shipping software as often as I can.  I’ll deploy to 3 production systems this week from a combination of my product and the consulting thats funding it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
