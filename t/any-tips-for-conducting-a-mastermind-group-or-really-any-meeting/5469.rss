    <title>Any tips for conducting a Mastermind Group (or really, ANY meeting)?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/any-tips-for-conducting-a-mastermind-group-or-really-any-meeting/5469</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve started a few mastermind groups.  What I&#39;ve learned so far is:

1. Have an Agenda
2. Have a dedicated moderator (we&#39;re going to start rotating that position)
3. Have a focus for each meeting, or group of meetings.
4. Limit Checkins (for Accountablity) to every 2 months or so.
5. Make sure everyone is heard and no one person dominates the conversation. (Not sure the best way to do that with video. I encourage folks to use the Chat, which would help introverts. So far doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem (everyone chimes in at some point on nearly all discussions)

            <p>We ran our own mastermind group for over two and a half years, and are just about to pull the plug now. I know a lot of people who are surprised it lasted this long.</p>
<p>We met in person, face to face every month, and hired a meeting room for the purpose.</p>
<p>We never had a moderator, but the format was that each person had a whole hour to bring whatever problem or issue they wanted to share. They also filled everyone in on their last month at the start.</p>
<p>It worked incredibly well because (a) we were so incredibly different from each other in terms of skills, personalities and businesses, (b) we had very clear ground rules (eg: no checking email or anything during someone else’s session), © we always had lunch together so got to know each other personally. Also (d) there were no egos involved, so no-one tried to run it. And I suppose (e) we were very lucky with the personalities involved.</p>
<p>We also had weekly accountability in a closed facebook group which helped.</p>
<p>To be honest it was <em>always</em> a pain in the arse to take a whole day off for it, but I always walked away enthused, charged-up with some seriously good ideas.</p>
<p>I’m going to miss it terribly! We have our final meeting next month - and then we’re all staying overnight at a hotel for a Christmas meal. It’ll be great - but also a little sad I think.</p>

            <p>Practice and exposure to techniques.</p>
<p>Like everything being a good facilitator means you need to practice is again, and again and again - make mistakes and learn, continually assess yourself - and ask for feedback from others, even if this makes you feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Exposure, I have learnt so much when I have been part of workshops, and watched facilitators, how they do things, what there format is - techniques can be learnt, read books, watch workshop videos online, research industry specific techniques &amp; styles.</p>

            <p>Folks in my Mastermind said accountability every 2 weeks was wayy too often (not enough done).<br>
I’m thinking something like once every month or two, so there’s something to report.</p>
<p>BTW, I think it’s VERY GOOD (beyond OK) to do a deep dive on one person’s business every few months.</p>
<p>My plan is to make each MM meeting a bit more focused (deeper). That can be b/c we are focusing on one person/member or one TOPIC.</p>

            <p>Hi Clay</p>
<p>Why do you think to limit accountability to every 2 months?</p>
<p>Also, if the group is already going for a while, I think it’s OK if there are some calls where there is a deeper dive into one person’s business, as long as it balances out in the long run.<br>
Sometimes some people have bigger things to discuss and for someone else it’s just business as normal and nothing major right now.</p>
