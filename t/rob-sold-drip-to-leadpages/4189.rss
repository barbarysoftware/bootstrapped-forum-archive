            <p>Not so much talks as outlines, frankly.</p>
<p>Except the fact that LP got the whole Drip team, I’ve got no info. Even his second podcast (with his wife) was richer in details in some sense.</p>

            <p>Rob mentioned in the last SFTROU podcast that he will cover the sale next week, as well as on his ZenFounder podcasts.</p>

            <p>I’d love to hear the backstory, but I suspect Rob is contractually bound to non-disclosure.</p>

            <p>From the announcement I’ve understood Rob is going to work for Leadpages at least for some time. That’s a kind of disappointment to me <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I was always looking up to Rob for an example of “self-standing man”. And now what, he’s an employee? o_O</p>
<p>Anyway, he has proven multiple times that he knows what he’s doing, and I guess he has very good, numbers-backed, reasons to do that. I can’t wait to hear those reasons.</p>
