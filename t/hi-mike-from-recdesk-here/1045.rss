    <title>Hi... Mike from RecDesk here</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-mike-from-recdesk-here/1045</link>
    <description>I&#39;m the founder of [RecDesk][1], a SaaS business servicing local Parks &amp; Rec departments and similarly focused organizations. I initially started RecDesk (in 2006) to free myself from the drudgery of the *corporate way of life*, but, over the years it&#39;s become *what I do* and big part of (at least in my mind) *who I am*. From the perspective of members of this forum, I guess you could say I&#39;m &quot;living the dream&quot; .....but lest anyone tell you any differently, the dream is freaking hard.

I followed the Joel forums back in the day (mainly in lurker mode) and have more recently enjoyed listening to some of the podcasts Ian and Andrey have put together. I can identify with many of the things Ian talks about regarding growing his company and enjoy the curmudgeony banter Andrey brings the table.
