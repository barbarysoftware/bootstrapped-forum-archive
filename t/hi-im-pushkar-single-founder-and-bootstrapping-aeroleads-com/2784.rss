    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Pushkar, Single Founder and Bootstrapping AeroLeads.com</title>

    <description>Hi, I found bootstrapped.fm through StartupWorkout post (which I found from growthahckers!) and thought I should register and post about myself.

I am a single founder and bootstrapping AeroLeads.com  which is a web based prospect and lead mining software. It searches hundreds of resources and find relevant prospects with contact details. I am still working on it to make it better and will really appreciate if I can get some feedback from you guys. The software is free currently so you can use it as much as you want. :)

Thanks</description>
