    <title>Making the product accessible and WCAG compliant</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/making-the-product-accessible-and-wcag-compliant/6412</link>
    <description>We had a couple of potential customers asking us for the:
- [Voluntary Product Accessibility Template](https://www.section508.gov/sell/vpat) (VPAT) 
- or how compliant we are with [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) (WCAG).

I&#39;m curious - how many people out there went through the process of making their product accessible and have a VPAT that they can present to their customers? 

What was the process like? Do you just go down the list of items in WCAG and check them off?</description>

            <p>Hmmm, no answer here.</p>
<p>I recommend you find a forum for web accessibility and ask again. Here’s one that might be helpful and seems to be active: <a href="https://webaim.org/discussion/">https://webaim.org/discussion/</a></p>
<p>It’d be great if you brought back any helpful info to this discussion!</p>
