    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Jon Behr from accountsportal.com</title>

    <description>Hi All,

I&#39;m the owner and founder of http://www.accountsportal.com. We&#39;re a SaaS business that has been going for about 4 years. We provide accounting and invoicing software to small businesses, freelancers, consultants, contractors, etc

We&#39;re 100% bootstrapped (and proud of it!).

We also provide consulting and development services (mostly Laravel), and this has (a bit surprisingly) mushroomed over the past few months.

We&#39;re in the process of building a new SaaS app (for ourselves), and on the lookout for a Laravel dev (preferably on location in London, UK). If you are interested in getting involved in a brand new product from the start and you&#39;ve got some Laravel + MySQL skills, then please get in touch! No formal work experience is necessary.</description>

            <p>Oh nice! We use FreeAgent at the moment. Looks like you guys offer a very similar service for a fraction of the cost.</p>
