    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Sean McKenna</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-sean-mckenna/251</link>
    <description>Hello, my name is Sean McKenna and I&#39;m a career software developer just getting started building my own business.      I&#39;m still figuring out what exactly my niche will be, and still working my day job in the meantime. 

I&#39;ve been looking for an online community for bootstrappers, and when I saw @patio11 mention this site, I hopped right over.  Looks like there is lots of great discussions already.  Also glad to be introduced to this podcast, as soon as I get a chance I&#39;ll start listening from the beginning.

Looking forward to meeting everyone!
