    <description>Hey everyone,

I&#39;ve been running a highly successful niche online retail site for the past 2 years ... what I find myself constantly battling with is reorder management.

We have a long lead time, so it&#39;s primarily it&#39;s a sales forecasting problem ... it takes about 3-4 months from placing the order with our factory in China to delivery. I need to know how many of each SKU to buy. So I want to know how many we sold in the months leading up to it, what our growth forecasts are, how many we have in stock and how long that&#39;s expected to last, how long will we have been sold out for before the stock arrives ... if our next order will be in 6 months, what&#39;s the 90% confidence level stock amount.

I&#39;ve built a homegrown tool which does some cool things ... but I really think there&#39;s an opportunity here that simple Inventory Management tools like TradeGecko et al aren&#39;t tapping. Anyone else in the same boat?</description>

            <p>Looking for something similar. I’m running a subscription business where each customer has a unique subscription. Each subscription consists of common, user-pickable products (inventory of 15, or so, + variants) which get delivered monthly.</p>
<p>Forecasting is a nightmare. For each product there is a minimum (a rather large one, due to custom packaging) I can order, plus the total bill has to exceed a certain amount. This means my stock of product A might be running low but it’s not enough to exceed the minimum amount. I can either wait, or add product B, which I currently don’t need but will be able to sell in the future, to the invoice.</p>
<p>Picking the right product B and optimising reorder times and quantities could be a huge win. Everything I’ve come across so far seems a bit too corporate-y.</p>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/andy">@Andy</a> - definitely don’t have the time to work on this right now (shiny objects!), given my MageMail project.  But it’s something that I may work on at my day job - but the solution will be very specific to the Magento platform, which is what we use.</p>

            <p>If any of you are serious about building something in this market, I suggest you drop Joannes Vermorel (who wrote the guest post) a line. He is very knowledgeable in this area and might be able to give you some useful pointers.</p>

            <p>This is pretty interesting. I spent a good chunk of time looking into inventory forecasting software for the ecommerce company that I work for.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-inventory-management-tool-Preferably-a-SaaS-Application" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-inventory-management-tool-Preferably-a-SaaS-Application</a></p>
<p>I didn’t really end up finding anything that seemed to fit very well so we’re likely going to build a significant chunk of this ourselves.</p>
<p>I’m pretty involved in the magento community and actually by bootstrapped side project is a magento module.</p>
<p>I think this could make a pretty sweet magento module.</p>

            <p>Certainly cool to see that other people think there’s a niche there … also agree that not having time to take on something else is the biggest problem!</p>

            <p>This concept has been in the back of my head since I read that post a while back, <a class="mention" href="/u/andy">@Andy</a>.  However, I shyed from trying to implement anything as its really far from my core expertise.  Seems like you’re in a good position to make something happen here, <a class="mention" href="/u/aidan">@aidan</a>.</p>
