    <title>What are good alternative names for : Coaching and Course and Subscription?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/what-are-good-alternative-names-for-coaching-and-course-and-subscription/5259</link>
    <description>My  Course is to teach someone to understand their loved one&#39;s speech-language difficulties, and provide some exercises for them to do at home.

A  **Course** could be:

* White Paper
* Guide
* Instructions
* Home Study

Coaching is a live guided tour of our therapy software. So we figure out what would work well for them, install it for them (as needed) and show them how to use it.



**Coaching:**
Could be :
 
* Instruction
* Tutorial
* Class
* Education
* Live Tour
* Live Coaching (kinda redundant :slight_smile: 



Any other ideas?</description>
