    <title>Hi I&#39;m Fabien - no product yet</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-fabien-no-product-yet/1135</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, I&#39;m Fabien. I&#39;ve been a developer for almost 15 years now - working mainly in Java doing web dev (B2B, B2C), e-commerce and a bit of mobile development.

For many years now I&#39;ve been interested in building a product of my own that would bring value. I would love to come up with some problems to solve and turn them into successful saas products.  I&#39;m currently brainstorming, trying to find my first problem/idea combo.

Right now I hope to learn from all of you, the great people of the bootstraping community! </description>
