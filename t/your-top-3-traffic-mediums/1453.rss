    <title>Your top 3 traffic mediums?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/your-top-3-traffic-mediums/1453</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;ve always had problems getting traffic outside word of mouth, I&#39;m curious what&#39;s your top 3 traffic source mediums, especially the ones that give the most leads(and I think others are interested as well)?
If you can provide a percent would be awesome. For example:
50% direct/word of mouth
20% email
10% referral

A more general question, when you started out...what were the first traffic sources that you taped in to get your first sales?

Thanks a lot</description>

            <p>For me, sales-wise, it’s:</p>
<ol>
<li>Door-to-door sales (you meet me in person then visit my website)</li>
<li>Personal referrals/word of mouth</li>
<li>SEO and referring websites</li>
</ol>
<p>So far <span class="hashtag">#3</span> has gotten me trial sign-ups but no paying customers yet. Leaky funnel.</p>

            <p>For my SaaS, Restaurant Engine, they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Organic search traffic</li>
<li>Direct (I guess mostly “not provided” search traffic &amp; word-of-mouth direct input)</li>
<li>Clicks from our email newsletters</li>
<li>A handful of industry-related referring sites</li>
<li>Some paid channels</li>
</ol>
<p>In the very very early days, I ran some low-budget Adwords to build a pre-launch list.  That was my very first traffic source.</p>
<p>Within 3-6 months, organic search traffic took over, thanks to a content marketing strategy.</p>
