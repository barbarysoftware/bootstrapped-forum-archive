    <title>MockupTiger Wireframes new Cloud version</title>

    <description>Hi 

 I have redesigned and re-coded the entire wireframing app and it is now available as a cloud service.

The unique thing about MockupTiger is that it allows to build dashboard and chart wireframes. Plus it provides comprehensive library for web and mobile. It does include material design icon and a total over 3000 icons.

Lot of effort went into and everything was coded from scratch. I had originally built this app in 2011 but due to other priorities never got to publish updates. As time passed, when I looked at it every widget in there required a re-make. Now that it is done and available, please try the app and share your feedback and suggestions. 

Here is the link https://www.mockuptiger.com

Thank you
Nilesh
PS: Also desktop version is coming soon..</description>
