    <title>From sign up to subscription</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/from-sign-up-to-subscription/5694</link>
    <description>Just sharing numbers:

1. Sign up. Automatic 14-days trial starts.
2. First 3 days are critical. We monitor every step and we proactively send &quot;how to&quot; emails.
3. If user has not logged in for more than 2 consecutive days (weekends excluded) during the trial - we have lost the lead.
4. If user is actively engaged, we are offering customized demo (we ask for use cases). In 90% of cases it happens in the second week of the free trial. 
5. For actively engaged users we typically extend trial 2 times.
6. Typically, it takes 40 days to convert the lead to customer. 
8. An average number of hours per week spent on supporting actively engaged user (before converting lead to subscription): 8

If somehow I could reduce it to 1-2 weeks I would be driving Ferrari.</description>

            <p>No ads. Email marketing (we bought a few lists), social (mostly Twitter), SEO. No content marketing per se but we do a have fairly regularly updated documentation, which is very much indexed by Google and regularly appears in searches.</p>

            <p>If you are asking about site visitors vs signups it’s less than 1%.</p>
<p>The conversion rate is ~ 10%.</p>
<p>Our SaaS is relatively complicated (easier than most of the competitors) and expensive (cheaper than most of the competitors).</p>

    I am just at the beginning of my first software project &amp; am having difficulties attracting users. 
I’m trying to gauge for stickiness right now. No payment, just onboarding &amp; attracting ppl to try it. I’m open to all thoughts! 
Thank you &amp; look forward to reading some advice, 
Kelvin
