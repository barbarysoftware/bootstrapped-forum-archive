    <title>Jumpstart your transactional emails with free templates?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/jumpstart-your-transactional-emails-with-free-templates/4514</link>
    <description>When I launched my app, designing, writing, building, and testing HTML emails was one of the most time-consuming and painful parts of the process. As a result, I started with plain text emails for the first couple of years. Switching to HTML emails turned into a month long project. It was worth it, but it was painful.

At Postmark, we&#39;ve been trying to make it easier and recently launched a set of [free open source templates](https://github.com/wildbit/postmark-templates) based on best practices for the most common transactional emails and an open source toolset ([MailMason](https://github.com/wildbit/mailmason)) to make the process suck exponentially less.

You can [preview the templates here](http://assets.wildbit.com/postmark/templates/). By default they&#39;re designed to be dropped into Postmark, but it&#39;s extremely easy to adapt them to any service. If you&#39;re launching a new app, I&#39;d expect these templates could save at least a week&#39;s worth of copywriting, design, building and testing. And they have all of the relevant best practices baked right in.</description>

<p>Huh, good point. I guess, the colour scheme and whatnot better be matching the application UI.</p>

<p>As a consumer, if I get a plain-text email from a company these days, I feel less confident in their abilities.</p>
<p>It is <strong>irrational</strong>, but this feeling is strongly there, no mistake.</p>

<p>Ah, I didn’t spot that you were talking about transactional emails. Now I’m a bit more curious!</p>

            <p>I can’t quantify it, but Derek’s emails are in a completely different context. Plain text is great for long-form personal emails and content, but transactional emails serve a completely different purpose. Nobody is looking for a long-form password reset email. They want a big simple button to click and maybe some help text in case something goes wrong. When your trial is expiring, you’re not looking for a nice letter, but clearly defined options about what you can do next or what will happen to your data.</p>
<p>With HTML emails, you’re able to create a much more user-friendly experience. Ultimately, transactional emails are an extension your software’s interface. Keeping them familiar, simple, easy-to-scan, readable, and pleasant helps way more than a plain text email would.</p>

<p>How worthwhile was it? Can you quantify?</p>
<p>Derek Sivers sends out the most basic text-only emails, and for some people, that’s actually a plus! But of course, I’m not Derek Sivers, so I’m interested to know what kind of difference there is between a basic text-only email and a sleek HTML email.</p>
