<p>I think that is much easier to do if you have your own product and are part of their community, rather than being a ‘content specialist’.</p>

</aside>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>But again it’s the same as sales.  It’s a lot easier to sell someone on something when you’re the founder of the company and creator of the product.  Gives you instant credibility that you wouldn’t have if you’re just a “sales rep”.  Does that make the sales profession useless?  Hardly.</p>
<p>And with the magento links, it’s true that 90% of the reason I got those links so easily was that I had very strong existing relationships.</p>
<p>Within the content marketing niche though I’m a nobody.  So the outreach that I’m doing is actually a lot closer to what my content-specialists-in-training will experience.</p>

            <p>I hear you man - trust me I know I have a sliminess factor to overcome due to the history of the industry.</p>
<p>Key word in what you said is “seems”.</p>
<p>A lot of people think sales “seems” sleazy.  But anyone who owns their own business or has ever interacted with a professional (and good) sales person, knows that couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>The proper kind of sales is all about solving peoples problems, actively listening, and providing value to them.  While at the same time being willing to take a step out and initiate a conversation / relationship.</p>
<p>Quality content outreach these days is all about building genuine relationships and offering genuine value to people.</p>
<p>Let’s say I wrote an article about something related to event planning that was actually useful to your customer base.  If I write the article and never reach out to you about it, 99% chance you’re never going to see it.</p>
<p>If I reach out in a spammy way, 99% chance you’re never going to read the email.</p>
<p>If I reach out in a genuine way, and offering you some content that’s <em>actually</em> valuable to your audience, there’s a chance that you’ll share it.</p>
<p>That’s what it’s all about.</p>
<p>I just landed two massive links to my site within the magento niche by literally just outreaching to people I already know.</p>
<p>And I also landed a phone call with the founder of a popular crm software in the outreach space by doing the same - just genuine, personal outreach on twitter and mentioning some ideas I had for improving their product.</p>
<p>Outreach doesn’t have to be sleazy.  And I’m gonna prove it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slightly_smiling.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling:"></p>

            <p>I like your motivation. But ‘content outreach’ seems such a shady business (with lots of spamming and article spinning). Also hard to measure the benefit of. I wonder if it is the optimal area to target?</p>
