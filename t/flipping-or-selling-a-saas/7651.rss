    <title>Flipping or selling a SaaS</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/flipping-or-selling-a-saas/7651</link>
    <description>I am interesting in options for flipping (selling) a Saas business. My main caveat is I don&#39;t want someone that will just want to screw it over to extract money and disappoint the current users who are small business owners. There are two part time employee&#39;s who preferably would stay on board (in Australia).

Health reasons make it difficult for me and I have other on going stuff as well.

What is the best place to look to find a conscientious buyer?</description>

            <p>As an aside, I’m quite interested in the approach people take when they look around for micro SaaS acquisitions. Do companies like SureSwift or <a class="mention" href="/u/charles">@charles</a> have defined methodologies that they follow to maximise return and add value?</p>

            <p>Get in touch with FE International (a broker) and/or SureSwift Capital (a serial acquirer). Both companies are always happy to talk about SaaS acquisitions without any obligation. This is a good starting point for selling. They’ll also give you a realistic idea of what price you can expect.</p>
<p>Regarding finding a conscientious buyer, that’s up to you to say no if you find a buyer but feel they are not right.</p>
<p>(Once you’ve sold the business, how it is run is out of your hands of course.)</p>
