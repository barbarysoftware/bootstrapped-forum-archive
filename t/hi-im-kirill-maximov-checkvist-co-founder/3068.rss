    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Kirill Maximov // Checkvist co-founder</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-kirill-maximov-checkvist-co-founder/3068</link>
    <description>Hello everyone,

  Glad to join a great company here. 

  I&#39;m a co-founder of [Checkvist](https://checkvist.com) - online outliner and task manager for geeks. It is a part-time project, and we started it with intention to create a tool to manage complex tasks, online, and completely from the keyboard. Over the time, we added lots of features, and now people even call it &quot;geek&#39;s swiss army knife&quot;. Like any outliner, Checkvist has many use cases, and may be useful to someone in this community as well.</description>

<p>Well, busy users do not read documentation. Not in this age, where everything is expected to be clear from the UI. You could at least make a note about re-opening in the status message.</p>
<p>P.S. I’m going via the trial (how come I could get the trial again? granted, it was actually usuful, because I totally forgot how it all works from the first time), and then I expect to convert. I’m not going to pay the ridiculously low monthly fee – I honestly suggest you to hide it – I’ll pay the annual one. And, for the record, my conversion features are 1) attachments 2) sharing. So I repeat again – NO ATTACHMENTS AND SHARING FOR FREELOADERS! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/laughing.png?v=5" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:"></p>

<p>By default, it will be reopened in couple of hours, but with the updated due date. Also, we have a separate option which defines when the task will be re-opened (<em>Generate…</em>).

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Hmm… I understand.</p>
<p>I was thinking about it, and I believe these two channels both have their pro and contra.</p>
<p>You already listed the pro of UI notification and contra of email. Let me list the opposite:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I read emails at my break hour, when I want to distract from the main activities. Reading short educational emails is perfect – it takes a very little time, but it is potentially useful. Since I’m not interrupted, it is not as annoying as you may guess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an UI tip pops up, it happens exactly when I’m working on something, and as such it is an interruption, and can be annoying. It also takes the precious real-estate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UI tips, due to screen size limitations, cannot be longer than 1-2 paragraphs. It may be harder to fit a useful instruction into this limited space, reducing the conversion rate (which in this case I define as a number of people who started using the feature). Email has less limitations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UI tips are more tactical, while email can be more strategic. I.e. a tip can tell me “to get the list of closed tasks within last week use …”, while email would tell something like “To build your invoice, use our smart filtering. Here’s how:…”.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I wouldn’t ignore one for another. I think they supplement each other.</p>

</aside>
<p>Of course you won’t if you need it this feature and if you don’t know about its existence yet. But if you know about it already - it is annoying. OK, I can send you such a tip only if you haven’t used this feature yet. Still, you might won’t have a chance to try it at the moment, or the context is wrong.</p>
<p>The better way is to show hints right in the interface, with a right context, and without annoyance. May be, on a separate panel. Something like Meduim shows at the screen bottom when you write a story. Hope I find a time to implement this.</p>

            <p>Re: pushing to <strong>Pro</strong>.</p>
<p>For me the Pro trigger would be the attachments. Not large ones, just attachments. I’d like to keep all the project documentation (5-10 files typically) next to the task list.</p>
<p>Checkvist is doing fine job there.</p>
<p>I’m just wondering if there is a faster way than right-click on Outlook attachment, save it to disk, then find that file in Checkvist and attach it?</p>
<p>Could it be streamlined somehow through the clipboard? Copy in Outlook, paste in Checkvist? With a help of some applet, flash or some other native code, may be?</p>
<p>I’m somewhat behind in what is possible in Web these days, so I do not know.</p>
<p>P.S. Of course, if I could attach the whole emails, it would be just terrific.</p>

</aside>
<p>I do use Personas in my commercial project, but with a major twist – them are real people, whom I see every day, and so it is very easy for me to “imagine” them.</p>
<p>Having said that, when I evaluate how a feature should look or behave, I do think how these two different people use it.</p>

<p>Then why do you believe it should be implemented for a <strong>Team</strong> tier? If it was a pain that users ready to pay to get rid of, prepayments would work, and the conversions to <strong>Team</strong> tier would increase, too.</p>

<p>Yeah, everyone does that. I recently found myself tinkering with a cool JS graph library that I managed to persuade myself JUST GOT TO BE used in my application. 3 days lost, and when I kinda awoke from that self-hypnosis, I realized I do not need it, at all - meaning <em>there is no value in it for the user</em>.</p>

<p>Case in question: I did not have any idea I could do that. And I’m not exactly a simpleton, I was using Checkvist before, and I’m using it again – and yet I’m uneducated in anything that is not in my main usage pattern.</p>
<p>If you sent me a email “Hey Vlad, do you need Checkvist to help you with your invoices? Do you know you can get the list of all the tasks you completed last week by doing this: …” – do you think I’d be upset?</p>
<p>First, you start your email with a very real benefit for me. Second, you’re not doing hard sell – you educate me. And if that feature turns out to be available in <strong>Pro</strong> only, well, it is something that I’ll have to think about.</p>

<p>After our long discussion, I started thinking about converting our existing PRO plan to Team account (with some modifications) and introducing a PRO plan with some features which were available for free. I think this may be technically easier. I will ponder the specific details of that.</p>

<p>Checkvist has many features, that’s true, and they may be not organized well from business perspective - so thanks for your advice on this.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve read a good method of doing it: you imagine a Persona, an imaginary user that is a <em>typical</em> user of every tier. For example, Free tier user would be an advanced computer user, working as a insurance broker, making lists to manage the work with client’s applications. Pro user would be an blogger who also has an offshore helper. Team is … and so on.</p>
<p>Then you can list all the features Checkvist has, and see if they are <strong>necessary</strong> or <strong>desired</strong> for each Persona.</p>

<p>What I’m trying to say is that the requests coming from free users are to be… not ignored, but taken with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Requests of paying customers are more likely to match the needs of other paying customers, hence improving the positioning of Checkvist as a business tool. Request of free users are more likely to match the needs of free users.</p>

<p>You said it - it usually goes to spam, even if it reaches inbox. And this is my personal experience as well - I hate getting bunch of e-mails after trying some service</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Here’s where you’re awfully wrong!</p>
<p>First, the emails do not normally go to spam. As soon as user replies or interacts with a email (clicks a link to confirm the email, for instance), the email is marked as safe.</p>
<p>But most importantly, you should stop thinking about yourself, what <strong>you</strong> hate. Quoting:</p>
<p><strong><em>You’re not your users!</em></strong></p>
<p>You hate to get educational emails precisely because you’re a super-user, and know things. But when you’re building a business, your users are regular computer users. They focus on their business problems, and do not step far from a safe path. If you show them how to do their work faster or easier with, say, multi-select – they will only be grateful to you.</p>
<p>Closer to your goals, the email sequences are demonstrated to increase revenues, sometimes 3-4x times. Not because it is pushy (how pushy can you become in a email? The Del button is always a click away), but because those emails show users useful features of the application that they <em>did not have an effing idea about</em> before.</p>
<p>Of course, the emails should have a value for the end user, <em>a simple user</em>. No point to send emails to your free nerds. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Except to nudge them to upgrade to Pro – again, but showing them useful features, such as assignments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We consider such a sharing as a mean to extend the user-base. And it works, we have a noticeable amount of new registrations coming from list sharing.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Understood, but here is the thing – what is the conversion rate for the referred users? I.e. how many of referred users become paid ones?</p>
<p>The growing of the userbase is not the goal. The goal is grow the <em>revenue</em>.</p>
<p>When you enable sharing for Pro only, I believe, it will serve two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Push free users into Pro tier (because it is a very useful feature)</li>
<li>Bring in new users that are more likely to become Pro (because Pro folks work with Pro folks)</li>
</ul>
<p>Making share available for Free users only grows the Free tier…  any list sharing is collaboration between two+ people, meaning some economic activity, meaning some profits. Get a cut of that profit! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Well, of course, sharing a list with a husband to buy a milk is sharing too.</p>
<p>OK, may be you should limit the number of shares. “One shared list for a free account.” Enough to share the groceries list, not enough for a business. Though I would still go with “sharing for Pro only”, because many Pros will only have one helper, i.e. one shared list may be enough. Zero lists is not, and so they migrate to Pro (hopefully).</p>

<p>I also assume that, since you’ve come here and introduced your project, you’re not fully satisfied with how it is going, and is looking for ways to improve. Hence the barrage of the suggestions.</p>

<p>I’d like to improve the business side of the tool. The most important task as I see right now is bringing more customers and to show Checkvist power to new users. Not converting existing free users to paying customers, but extending the number of users via some marketing and promotion.</p>

<p>Practically, I think it is pretty easy to do – you need to review all the accounts that have access by 3+ people (that would be considered a team), and see how there usage pattern differs from accounts with 2 people (those I would call Pro – a rainmaker and a helper). Then put the differences into Team tier.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I can only find out lists with 3+ people. It is not difficult. But I’m not sure I understand what you mean by <em>analyze usage patterns</em> in this context. We have several thousands of such lists from different customers, so doing this manually is a hardly feasible task.</p>

<p>We don’t send extra e-mails after the registration. You said it - it usually goes to spam, even if it reaches inbox.

If a customers used the service, and stopped - we ask, why this happens. If a registered user didn’t visit us after the first day - we ask, if we can help. Only once, of course.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is public, but has quite a cryptic path. I haven’t fixed it yet.<br>
I think the file became unavailable due to its transfer to the rackspace cloud (where we store attachments), and Checkvist removed the old local copy too early. I’ll  fix it, along with access issue.</p>

        <title>Hi, I&#39;m Kirill Maximov // Checkvist co-founder</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[rfctr]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Now, sidetracking.</p>
<p>I also have an idea of a white-labeled application on the Checkvist engine.</p>
<p>I would have already jumped on it if I had time. So for time being I’ll just leave it here for you or anyone else to grab.</p>
<p><strong>Codename: Implementation Plan</strong></p>
<p>As you know, implementation (AKA deployment) plans in large companies are complex, sometimes very complex. The plans often touch dozens of applications, which should be re-pointed, stopped, updated or restarted in a very precise order and manner, or the consumers will see some functionality unavailable.</p>
<p>I was making such plans for my operations team in a large bank for a year, and IT IS A EFFING PAIN! Each plan took 3 to 4 weeks to prepare, 2 to 3 meetings every week, daily meeting in the last week, participation of all the teams of all the affected applications, numerous changes (where I had to reevaluate the dependencies and recalculate the start-end time, and check them against different conditions e.g. “do we still fit into the deployment window?”).</p>
<p>But an implementation plan (AKA MOP, Method of Procedure) is just a checklist, where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tasks shall be executed in a given order, at a given time</li>
<li>Some tasks depend on others and cannot be started before them</li>
<li>Each task is assigned to its own dedicated person or team. Only that person or team can report the task closed.</li>
<li>May be ACLs, i.e. attachments in a task could be made accessible by the assignee only (may contain PROD credentials), but that is not critical - credentials can an should be delivered by a more secure channel</li>
<li>As the execution progresses, the list of watchers gets notifications how it goes (instant or hourly)</li>
<li>The status is also available on an URL</li>
</ul>
<p>As I can see, Checkvist could have been a engine for this product. It lack only:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start time for a task (it has due date, but it is not the same)</li>
<li>Duration for a task (missing)</li>
<li>Dependency for a task (missing)</li>
<li>ACLs</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I do not plan to start working on it this year <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<p>But what would be your estimate, how hard to add those properties to the tasks without affecting the rest of the code?</p>
<p>May be there a way to use some sort of custom properties for a white-labeled application?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Checkvist is a generic outliner, packed with features. And can be used for very different purposes and in different areas. People make checklists, write books and blog posts, have birthday calendars, collect notes. And this makes marketing hard.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>And it shows. Your copy and overall marketing material is all over the place, trying to fit everyone. That makes it unfocused and I’m sure reduces the conversions.</p>
<p>(Strictly speaking, your copy, even not taking into account the business part, is far from ideal. This: “Create and share checklists, plans, and outlines” is not a good headline. It focuses on what it can do, and not what benefit the user will get. The benefit would be something like “Take control over your life with checklists” or “Execute complex plans with no mistakes and omissions” and so on. Users do not want to create checklists, they want to solve their problems.)</p>
<p>But let’s get back to the business part of the tiers.</p>
<p>What I would do is:</p>
<p>Step 1.</p>
<p>Create a separate landing page, <a href="http://business.checkvist.com" rel="nofollow noopener">business.checkvist.com</a>.</p>
<p>There I would focus on the benefits for businesses only. Do not even mention the free accounts.</p>
<p>I would put the AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) in place.</p>
<p>The (A) attention-grabber I’d borrow right from the article above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a simple checklist can transform <em>intensive care</em>, what can it do for <em>your</em> business?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I’d follow <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s16/sh/e7b03c7e-2d4e-40b5-b7bd-86cabf6caa1a/7fdb46733931e9aa82377a857adc8675" rel="nofollow noopener">this guide</a> step by step (I used it <a href="http://genericparallel.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the horrors of what happens when employees do not follow the instructions</li>
<li>Tell them that a checklist is a solution</li>
<li>Tell them you know a thing or two about checklists and are running this business for years</li>
<li>Show benefits (reduced rate of errors, timely execution, no omissions, being in control)</li>
<li>Social proof (preferrably feedback from other business owners about Checkvist, but could also be general statement about usefulness of checklists for a business)</li>
<li>Offer (“Only $9.95 per user per month!”)</li>
<li>Provide a guarantee (promise them they will improve in 3 months, or get full refund)</li>
<li>Scarcity… hmm… well, make $9.95 a limited time offer; regular price is $19.95 per user per month.</li>
<li>… and so on, following the template.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 2.</p>
<p>I would make a blog on the same site (/blog or <a href="http://blog.business.checkvist.com" rel="nofollow noopener">blog.business.checkvist.com</a>). There, each week, I’d post summaries of articles I’ve found on internet (there are plenty of them) about How X Made a Great Success with Business Y Using Checklists. Each article would follow the same plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell about a success (or a failure!) X had</li>
<li>Show how it can be achieved (or avoded) using Checkvist Business, with screenshots or animated gifs</li>
<li>Call to action</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, focus on one Checkvist feature per article. This week is attachments, next is task assignments, yet next is reports.</p>
<p>Make sure the keywords (“checklist, business, …”) are somewhere in there.</p>
<p>In some time, Google will pick it up and start sending you the organic traffic.</p>
<p>The stories should also give you some ideas about what features are important for businesses.</p>
<p>(Another good book about checklists in business – well, more like rules, but still – is <a href="http://www.workthesystem.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Work the System</a>)</p>
<p>(I use <a href="https://wordy.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://wordy.com/</a> to proof-read my posts. Highly recommend.)</p>
<p>Step 3. Business pricing</p>
<p>I believe, the pricing page for Business tier should be totally separate from the regular Checkvist. The reason is that the prices page is not the end of the road. It should continue to sell, i.e. on the prices page you still need to reiterate the benefits you provide, specifically for business. If you have all tiers on the same page, it makes it hard to co-exist with benefits for Pro, and for Free plan.</p>
<p>So I’d say – make a separate pricing page under <a href="http://business.checkvist.com" rel="nofollow noopener">business.checkvist.com</a>, and make 3 tiers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enterpreneur (essentially Pro, 2 users max).</li>
<li>Small Business (up to say 20 users, and may be some extra features, say, ACLs?)</li>
<li>Enterprise (unlimited users, contact us for the price – because the fortification or a dedicated cluster may be needed)</li>
</ol>
<p>The smallest price tier can be $9.95 or even $4.95 per user per month (but do not make it $1, you’re not a Dollarama!), the Small Business should start at $9.95 or $14.95 or … you can adjust the prices as you go.</p>
<p>You will probably have to implement ACLs on tasks, a Manager and Employee roles. Nothing more complex than that, at least until you prove it all works and you get demanding customers.</p>
<p>You would have to redesign the UI of the Checkvist Business a bit, getting rid of all links to the regular site, make it feel more businessy. White-labeling is required (allow the business to set their business’ color and logo, and links to their resources, e.g. Help desk, for their employees).</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>That all shouldn’t be much work, but you effectively separate business marketing from free marketing, and it should help both.</p>

<p>That (team-oriented checklists) could be a whole separate product (which could share the same codebase with Checkvist, just needs a very different marketing).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The fun thing is, you can use such a kind of process in Checkvist already.</p>
<p>You can create a list, name it “Template: Weblogic+OSB11g”. Fill it with tasks. When you need to perform this procedure for an existing customer, you copy/clone this list “toolbar=&gt;more actions=&gt;Copy(Move) to another list”, make appropriate modifications and pass it to operations team. Easy as that. You can try it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>And from our business perspective, here comes the marketing part. Checkvist is a generic outliner, packed with features. And can be used for very different purposes and in different areas. People make checklists, write books and blog posts, have birthday calendars, collect notes. And this makes marketing hard.</p>
<p>One idea I had is to create dedicated landing pages for specific tasks and promote it via AdWords. Not sure if it will work, never used AdWords before.</p>

</aside>
<p>Checklists are everywhere, just not always materialized.</p>
<p>In operations teams, checklists are helping a lot, but unfortunately not used very often. You can tell which team uses checklists by the number of configuration mistakes they make.</p>
<p>Which is yet another possible feature for your <strong>Team</strong> account: checklist template: create a new checklist based on a template for a specific procedure. E.g., imagine a process called “Configure Weblogic with OSB 11g for consumer domain”. This process has some 50 steps. Our operations team repeats it pretty often (we have ~100 weblogic test domains), with some variations needed depending on project (usually endpoints). They are using a Word document called “Migration Sheet”, executing as they read, and geez, in 50% of cases the environment has at least one issue - due to missed steps.</p>
<p>Instead, they could have made a checklist template for this process. For every new project the DEV team would create an instance of that list, updated the necessary endpoints, credentials and whatnot, and passed it down to operations, to scratch down the steps one by one – and be sure nothing is missing.</p>
<p>The operations work all consists of a large number of standard step-by-step checklists-like tasks.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of other teams in the world that have to follow checklist-list procedures.</p>
<p>That (team-oriented checklists) could be a whole separate product (which could share the same codebase with Checkvist, just needs a very different marketing).</p>

<p>Good article, though a long read it is. I’ve heard some facts from it before, but not in such detail, definitely.</p>
<p>In my work practice, checklists are really useful for code reviews, when it is done on a regular basis in a team. Some our clients use checklists for release process.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>P.S. BTW, the changelog feature I mentioned – it is certainly <strong>Pro</strong>. The idea is that for my professional tasks I need to build an invoice at the end of the period. The easiest way is (if using Checkvist) to review the tasks closed within the period.</p>
<p>Of course, the spent time is nice to add to that… may be some modificator to space key, e.g. Ctrl-Space to ask for time… or easier yet, first Ctrl-Space to set time to 1 hr, second Ctrl-Space to 2 hrs and so on (configurable).</p>
<p>And, another “of course” is that you should poll your users if they need it. <em>I</em> need it, but I’m just a single user.</p>
<p>P.S. Note that <a href="https://letsfreckle.com/">some people pay $20 a month</a> for essentially this feature alone.</p>
<p>P.P.S. Used Upgrade to Trial for using attachments. <em>Issue</em>: the changes are not immediately in effect. The [at] menu is still grey. Only when I went to settings and back, it got enabled.<br>
Now, this is the right placement for this feature! Attachments are <strong>Pro</strong>, no doubt. Large attachments then should be for <strong>Team</strong> and available in <strong>Pro</strong> as an $1 add-on.<br>
Complain: the file icon is not reflecting the file type. I have PowerPoint (*.pptx) attached, and the icon is for a generic file.</p>
<p>P.P.P.S. Another potential <strong>Pro</strong> add-on is the password-encryption of the list after the session end. I.e. the list is stored encrypted on the server; only when I login and enter my list password, it gets decrypted – into memory. If someone steals the database, the list is not readable. (Again, poll is required).</p>
<p>P.P.P.P.S. Long file names in attachments cannot be read. When there mouse is not over, they are truncated. When it is over, they overlap to the next name. Given that many files in my projects have the same long prefix (project name, project code, and only then the differential part), I cannot really tell which file is which.</p>

            <p>Hello again, <a class="mention" href="/u/kir">@kir</a>.</p>
<p>Sorry for not following up for long, I was without inet at home, and was conserving my traffic.</p>
<p>First, I’d like to make it clear that all that is said here, is said in a good faith and with a desire to help, and not as a critique of the service. Just in case my comments sound too rude.</p>
<p>I also assume that, since you’ve come here and introduced your project, you’re not fully satisfied with how it is going, and is looking for ways to improve. Hence the barrage of the suggestions.</p>
<p>If you’d be more specific what is your goal, the suggestions may become more targeted, BTW <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>So, my first question would be: <strong>are you looking to improve Checkvist as a business, or as a free service?</strong></p>
<p>I was assuming “as a business” (living close to US affects one’s thinking), and hence all my suggestions were targeted that way.</p>
<p>But I can totally imagine this service be a great “body of work” project that helps the owner to find new consulting gigs.</p>
<p>So, what’s your ideal vision for Checkvist?</p>
<p>(BTW, the name Checkvist is impossible to remember. I was going to refer it to a friend a few years ago, and found that I couldn’t recall the name! I guess it is because the “vist” part means nothing.)</p>

<p>Export to OPML is not PRO because we don’t want to force people to pay if they want to migrate to another tool. It doesn’t feel ethic, kind of “pay us if you want to leave us”.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It wouldn’t be ethic, for sure. I though do not suggest to block the OPML export completely. Make it available to the free tier if they decided to close the account. E.g., just email the exported lists to them after the account is closed.</p>
<p>Then there is a question of how many freeloaders actually need the export. Me, for example – my list is less than 100 items long, and, even if I had no export, I could always copy the list manually. I do not have a use for closed tasks.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are users with much longer, detailed lists. But those are <strong>Pro</strong> in my book.</p>

<p>Creating tasks via E-mail could be PRO, and we wanted to make it so. But this feature was developed by a friend and a customer. He created a free online service which offered this feature using our OpenAPI, so we just adopted it inside Checkvist.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Hmm… This is a tricky story.</p>
<p>Email is one of the most useful media for Pro users. Your service however gave it away to a free service. Now a whole direction of potential development is blocked by this free offering. That service, strictly speaking, has no legal commitment to your service, and (correct me if I’m wrong) is not necessary aligning its plans with Checkvist.</p>
<p>All in all, I would consider what email-related features are useful for <strong>Pro</strong> users (forward, tasks from email, changelog, …), and offered them in the Pro version only.</p>
<p>I would remove all email features from the <strong>Free</strong> tier. The free tier could still use email via that OpenAPI service, but that would not be prominent in the documentation.</p>

<p>but we need more features to make Team offer more attractive. Something like Slack integration. Hope we’ll implement something like this later this year.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think you have enough features to justify the third tier. You just need to re-arrange them.</p>
<p>Also, you may have the same features, but set different usage limits.</p>
<p>Practically, I think it is pretty easy to do – you need to review all the accounts that have access by 3+ people (that would be considered a team), and see how there usage pattern differs from accounts with 2 people (those I would call <strong>Pro</strong> – a rainmaker and a helper). Then put the differences into <strong>Team</strong> tier.</p>
<p>You can add Slack integration when requested. Slack is cool and all that, but it has to be proven that the paying customers want it. For my team, for instance, Slack is blocked by corp security. (Checkvist is not <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> however it would be as soon as corp security learns that some corp data are stored on external service).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, probably, but we don’t have a huge demand for bigger attachments.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It doesn’t matter <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>When a business decides what layer they want, they will grab all the features they <em>might</em> potentially need.</p>
<p>For example, it was only once in 3 years that we needed to share a large file with all of our team. But if we’d be buying an account, we’d surely included “large attachments” – just in case. The price difference is negligible for a business.</p>
<p>Another example – our management offered us each to install a plugin for Outlook that lists TFS tickets related to us. The plugin costs $100 per seat. The management provided this reasoning: it takes about a minute to start Eclipse or VS to get an access to a TFS. Full cost of a worker time is about $1-1.5/minute. Even if the plugin saves us only 1 minute a day, it will pay for itself in 3 months.</p>
<p>So… make a <strong>Team</strong> tier, please.</p>
<p>I have to note again though that adding the <strong>Team</strong> tier requires re-balancing of the free and Pro tiers.</p>

<p>but currently Checkvist mobile is in the alpha state and misses some critical features.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There is a guy who made an application that supports Checkvist on Android.</p>
<p>That makes me think of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>May be it worth to “offload” the development of the mobile client to him (or anyone willing). I understand you have a very limited hands-on capacity.</li>
<li>The access to Checkvist API should only be available to <strong>Pro</strong>. It could be meter-based, but it is not fully fair game, when someone makes a commercial application, and uses your API for free.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Re: Usage on mobile</strong></p>
<p>I have tried to use Checkvist web-application on mobile phone with a large screen (Sony Xperia Ultra, 6.4" screen), and two things prevented me from any usage:</p>
<ol>
<li>The fonts and everything are too small. I had to squint my eyes. It is clear that the mobile version must have a different CSS.</li>
<li>The selling point of Checkvist – keyboard actions – become the downside, because the virtual keyboard continue to popup and disappear, seemingly randomly. I wonder if it is possible for a web site to tell the keyboard to stick?</li>
<li>Then again, Checkvist with mobile CSS could be a <strong>Pro</strong> tier.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>The standalone company-hosted version would require much more effort and support than we’re ready to provide right now. It is truly a separate big project.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I see. As I have said already, the usage of Checkvist from inside of old-style corporations can be blocked any moment, because the standard policy is not to store any internal information on outside servers.</p>
<p>A hosted version could help with it.</p>
<p>Another option is a plugin for SharePoint and/or Outlook/Exchange.</p>
<p>Now, I do not believe you should <strong>do</strong> any of that now, but you should start collecting the requests. I.e. (may be) put something like “Hosted version (WIP)” under the <strong>Team</strong> tier and ask the subscribers what are their requirements for that. You can also fire a quite survey of your current users that are having corporate email.</p>
<p>I know our team would love to have a shared ToDo, but there are policies. First is the already mentioned security thing, and then, I believe, it is required that all data are stored on SharePoint.</p>
<p>I’m sure other corporate accounts have their own policies, and it is not wise to start investing into something before you know the field better.</p>
<p>Who knows, may be you’d have to exclude <strong>Corp Team</strong> and only have <strong>Small Startup Team</strong> tier, i.e. teams under 20 in numbers with little or no bureaucracy.</p>
<p><strong>Re: Using Checkvist on large screens</strong></p>
<p>One more note: I have started to use Checkvist again, and this time I have learned the keyboard first. It goes much better now, I may stick with it for long. We’ll see.</p>
<p>What I noticed however is that the screen layout seems to be designed for 15" monitor. I.e. on my ThinkPad it looks perfect - no wasted space, and yet everything is clearly visible. When I dock my ThinkPad though, and work on 28" monitor, there are huge wasted fields on the sides. A whole second column of tasks could have fit in the space – or may be, a secondary list.</p>
<p>Adding the aforementioned issue with Checkvist on mobile, I think you should consider a CSS that re-arranges the layout. For instance, Hints sidebar should disappear if the window is too narrow, and such.</p>

<p>Multiple selection is a very useful feature, but it doesn’t seem like a PRO feature to me. But that’s just me.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>It is not a feature at all, IMHO. It is a precursor for other features. You select multiple items to do some bulk operations. So the bulk operation is the feature.</p>
<p>Now, is bulk operation more useful for a <strong>Pro</strong> or <strong>Team</strong> user, that to a <strong>Free</strong> one?</p>
<p>I’m not sure it is.</p>
<p>Both <strong>Free</strong> and <strong>Pro</strong> can close multiple tasks at once. <strong>Pro</strong> or <strong>Team</strong> can bulk-assign a number of tasks to another user, but it is the assignment that is a <strong>Pro</strong> feature, not bulk itself.</p>
<p>So in essence, I believe multiple select should be equally available for all.</p>

<p>Yeah, this is the important note.</p>
<p>With all the suggestions above I assumed that the existing accounts are grandfathered, unless it is too hard to do technically (it shouldn’t be; at worst case you can migrate them to <strong>Pro</strong> and provide a 10 years worth of credit).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>as well as about eliminating the free plan altogether</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You shouldn’t eliminate them, I believe. Not now, anyway.</p>
<p>But limiting the number of lists (AKA projects) is a reasonable thing to do. And it will be understood by the community, because more lists = more records in the database = more load on the server. It is not an artificial limitation, but a very reasonable one.</p>
<p>As for number of lists… again, you have your usage stats. How many lists a typical active free user has? I’d guess 1. I have 3 already, but one is for my commercial project, and one for my client’s projects, hence I should be in <strong>Pro</strong> tier (but you did not push me into it, so I’m staying). Later I may want to share some of those lists with my coworkers – and that should <strong>NOT</strong> be possible if I’m not <strong>Pro</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Re: Email sequence</strong></p>
<p>I have noticed that you do not send me emails with tips and updates (do you? may be they go to spam?).</p>
<p>If you’re serious about <strong>Pro</strong> and <strong>Team</strong>, you should build the sequences for <strong>Free</strong> (pushing them to <strong>Pro</strong> and <strong>Team</strong>) and for <strong>Pro</strong> (pushing them to <strong>Team</strong>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If someone refers 5 users they could get a free PRO upgrade for 6 months or something along those lines.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Good idea. But it could also backfire. The new users referred by <strong>Free</strong> are all <strong>Free</strong>. A referral from a <strong>Pro</strong> would be a more useful thing, but <strong>Pro</strong> are not as inclined to work hard for a few extra dollars – they presumably have a good income already.</p>
<p>I believe promoting “share” and “assign” features to <strong>Pro</strong> would generate a better quality referrals – i.e. the <strong>Pro</strong> would share and assign to coworkers, which means to potentially <strong>Pro</strong> users themselves.</p>

            <p>Hello Dan,</p>
<p>Thanks for your thoughts (and for your latest payment)</p>
<p>Actually, we tried using a referral program. The idea was to pay back users who refer Checkvist to other customers, who finally become PRO. We used an external service to implement this, <a href="http://www.referralcandy.com" rel="nofollow noopener">ReferralCandy</a>. It haven’t worked at all for us (the new traffic was negligible), and after 3-4 months we canceled this program.</p>

<p>I consider Dropbox a good example of having a great free service with a gentle push to upgrade when you’re using it more. Of course they also used the referral program to grow. Have you thought about that as a method to grow? If someone refers 5 users they could get a free PRO upgrade for 6 months or something along those lines.</p>
