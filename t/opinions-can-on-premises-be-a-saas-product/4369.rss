    <title>Opinions : Can On Premises be a SaaS product</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/opinions-can-on-premises-be-a-saas-product/4369</link>
    <description>Hi All,

Working on a product that is Hard Boiled On Premises, no chance of it going Cloud unless it is private cloud.
Server configuration Management and Automation (think Puppet/Chef but PowerShell DSC) , web based ,SQL server back end, engine is PS remoting. Has LDAP integration etc, roles and blah blah.

I am looking at selling it as a monthly renewal like SaaS but with the server licence to be updated every month.

I would like to know any opinions and reasons behind the opinion and if it is a stupid way to do it or mad genius or just a hard sell.

Cheers

            <p>Like <a class="mention" href="/u/rfctr">@rfctr</a>, I would also say annual licenses could be better.</p>
<p>Might be harder to sell due to up-front investment, but quality of customers should also be increased by that fact.</p>

<p>That would be too much trouble for any on-premise setup (unless the configuration is something they really need to do once or twice a year, like a release LT setup). I’d think of annual licenses.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, companies already do that. See SmartBear’s ServiceV – it is an on-premise application, but with a annual license.</p>
<p>The benefit of SaaS tho is a convenience of deployment on demand. Can your product provide that? May be a Docker image or a VMware one? If not, it is still a on-premise application - which still can have an annual billing.</p>
