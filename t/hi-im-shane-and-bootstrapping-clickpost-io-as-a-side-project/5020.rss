    <title>Hi I&#39;m Shane and bootstrapping clickpost.io as a side project</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-shane-and-bootstrapping-clickpost-io-as-a-side-project/5020</link>
    <description>I enjoy creating web projects, which genrally lead to more web projects. That&#39;s where ClickPost comes in. 

SEO was always an afterthought, and I didn&#39;t understand what sort of black magic was occurring to make some of my sites do well while others didn&#39;t. I always set up Google Search Console for each site, but didn&#39;t always understand it or remember to check out the data. 

ClickPost solves this problem by sending weekly Search Console reports for site owners, and I recently added an agency plan to send white label reports to clients.

Please let me know what you think! Thanks.</description>
