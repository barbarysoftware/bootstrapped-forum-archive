    <title>Startup Example Docs &amp; Failure Timeline of Flowtab</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/startup-example-docs-failure-timeline-of-flowtab/483</link>
    <description>Saw this post on Tech Crunch, [The Decline And Fall Of Flowtab, A Startup Story][1]. Its a long read but valuable insights to hear. 

Even more important than the story, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Flowtab actually is [sharing all of it&#39;s documents &amp; materials][2] they used (pitch deck, sales sheets, etc) with the startup community-at-large. There&#39;s also a great timeline which offers a much more simple explanation of their rise and fall. 

Really cool IMHO because its always nice to see how other folks are doing it. Of course, it goes without saying that you might not want to use the documents of a failed startup to try and establish your own successful one, but surely there&#39;s some gold in that dirt.

Cheers!
