    <title>Hi I&#39;m Brandon and I like to build stuff</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-brandon-and-i-like-to-build-stuff/934</link>
    <description>Hi! I&#39;m Brandon Hilkert. I’ve been in technology for about 10 years now – the last handful doing Ruby development. I’m passionate about everything web.

At some point in there, I got involved with startups and building products. While I don’t have a list of impressive acquisitions to share, I love it and can’t imagine myself doing anything else.

I&#39;ve been working on writing a book and blogged about my experiences thus far at [http://brandonhilkert.com][1]
