            <p>It’s psycological/cultural I suppose. I simply do not trust anyone, especially people who I’ve never seen. I’m just not comfortable if they have all the source code. I understand that in real life there’s little chance of them actually starting a new product based on stolen code and then competing with me. But still.</p>
<p>You have a protection based on your relations with Trello, so one starting a “competing” “Borello” product has little chances for success. But a downloadable Windows software is a different thing.</p>

            <p>interesting, what is the specific limitation that you can’t share the complete source code with freelances?</p>

            <p>Great episode, thanks!</p>
<p>Sharing the complete source code with freelancers is what I would never do. I just can’t. This is a sort of thing that’s simply impossible for me to do.</p>
<p>I design a product in such a way so that hired force can program separate parts and I then integrate it into the product.</p>
