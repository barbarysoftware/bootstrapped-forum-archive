    <description>Hi everyone. My name is Jason and I&#39;m an artist / independent product designer, solopreneur and Chief Happiness Officer (CHO).  A smattering of my work is @ http://jasoncomely.com 

I&#39;m working on half a dozen projects right now. Some have a practical application and others are flat out weird. I may ask for insights regarding them in the nearish future.

Nice to meet you all.</description>
