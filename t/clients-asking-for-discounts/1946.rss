    <title>Clients asking for discounts</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/clients-asking-for-discounts/1946</link>
    <description>Our SAAS pricing is basically done on a user level basis, 2, 8 or unlimited users. I am considering changing this to 1, 5, 10, Unlimited but for now that is what we have. Anyway, it is not uncommon for clients to who have 3 users to ask for a discount, or to be able to go on the lower level plan.

What is your strategy for dealing with this? Do you just give them the discount out of good will?

One thing I am considering is if I give them the discount but ask for a testimonial in exchange.</description>

            <p>The rare couple of times someone asked a discount, I exchanged a few emails with them and there was always a misunderstanding about the benefits of the product.</p>
<p>So my focus is: explaining the value brought by the product (with more depth) to this specific customer, and then rework my copy if needed so that the value is explained in better shape.</p>
<p>My rule of thumb is the same as <a class="mention" href="/u/coreysnipes">@coreysnipes</a>.</p>

</aside>
<p>When you’re starting off and trying to capture market share, then discounts may make sense. To think of it another way: can you walk away from this sale ? If yes, then don’t offer it. If no, then do offer it.</p>
<p>This does, however, become a double edged knife: once you give out a discount that’s not advertised, that client/user may come back with more referrals - which can be good for networking effects, but bad because you may be leaving revenue on the table.</p>

            <p>Regards charities asking for discounts: My wife volunteers for a community radio. It is run entirely by volunteers. They take ads because they still have pay for the music they play, and things like rent, bills etc.</p>
<p>Everyone knows this is a non-profit radio, mainly because the hosts repeat the message. And yet, the station manager gets calls from other charities asking for freebies.</p>
<p>“Come on, we are doing it for a good cause.”<br>
“So are we,” the manager always replies.</p>
<p>Not only do charities, but the local government asks for freebies too.</p>
<p>Like the station manager usually tells us, charities are used to paying for  a lot of things. They have to pay rent, bills, in some cases salaries. They are used to paying for things, just like any business.</p>
<p>So don’t feel guilty about saying no to charities.</p>

            <p>My experience echoes <a class="mention" href="/u/andy">@Andy</a>’s.  Discount requests serve as a warning that the customer is going to be anything but your best.  With the plugins I run, I already offer discounted packages when you buy the whole bundle and I get people asking to get those for free because they’re a non-profit or someone that “can’t afford it”.</p>
<p>I respond to discount requests with a line from Sarah Hatter’s <a href="http://cshandbook.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Customer Support Handbook</a> (a must-read for all SaaS owners, IMO):</p>
<p><em>“We’ve priced our products fairly so they’re economical for all types of businesses, including non-profits.  We also offer a free version you’ll never be charged to use.  To treat all our customers equally, we’re not offering additional discounts at this time”</em></p>
<p>Asking for a discount is just a signal to me that you’re not my ideal customer and will have a hard time seeing value in things.</p>

            <p>I only give volume discounts when the organization has many users. I wouldn’t give a discount if they only had 3 users, but I would if they had 50.</p>

</aside>
<p>If I think it will make the difference between a sale and no sale, I might.</p>
<p>But bear in mind that customers that ask for a discount are unlikely to be your best customers. Asking for a big discount is a warning flag.</p>

</aside>
<p>That sounds a bit sleazy IMHO. It is hardly a genuine testimonial if they have been effectively paid (with a discount) to give it. Asking them after they have paid is ok though.</p>
