    <title>I&#39;m sharing a Knowledge Base template you can start from for your SaaS</title>

    <description>Hi there,

Recently, I&#39;ve been a bit busy building a Knowledge Base for my bootstrapped SaaS app, using Git, Jekyll, Liquid, Ruby.

Inspired by KissMetrics who did the same at some point (but their setup was a bit too rich for me), I&#39;m sharing the full code I&#39;m using as an [open-source repository][1], from which you can start from.

I also made a fairly detailed write-up of everything I learned in the process (including details such as how to generate screenshots or animated gifs), you can find it here:

A great thing about this is that I can now collaborate with people who are less technical, on a dedicated git repo, without having to open the main git repo of my app source code.

Hope this will be useful to some of you.
