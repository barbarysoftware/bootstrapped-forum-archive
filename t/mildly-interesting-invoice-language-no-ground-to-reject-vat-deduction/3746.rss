    <title>[MILDLY-INTERESTING] Invoice language no ground to reject VAT deduction</title>

    <description>Hey,

I stumbled upon the Twitter account of the EU Tax &amp; Customs Department and decided to ask them a question that has been on my mind for a while. 

Their response was pretty swift I have to say: https://twitter.com/EU_Taxud/status/684058417670021120

From my understanding of the documentation provided national authorities can NOT generally require you to translate all invoices into national language.</description>

            <p>Bejezus! A quick and accurate answer! With references!</p>
<p>They really need to get their act together and stop that unwarranted helpfulness before other govt. departments start getting a bad rep for being slow, uncommunicative, unapproachable, obtuse and generally useless.</p>
<p>Oh waitâ€¦</p>
