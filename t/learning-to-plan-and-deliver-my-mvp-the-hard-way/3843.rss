    <title>Learning to plan and deliver my MVP the hard way</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/learning-to-plan-and-deliver-my-mvp-the-hard-way/3843</link>
    <description>I wanted to learn how to create and deliver a project that was simple enough for one person to build and something people wanted.  I went through the process of identifying ideas that were worthwhile to build and chose one **TrixCamp**.

Essentially for me it came down to identifying these things:

1. **Why** - Problem you’re having
2. **How** - Solution you’re proposing
3. **What** - Benefits it will provide
4. **Goals** - Short and long term ideas about what your project will achieve.
5. **Income** - Subscription, ads, single purchase, hourly or is it for fun?
6. **Minimum Viable Product Features**
7. **Ideas** - For the long term what would be beneficial features

The learning project I built was called TrixCamp.  A simple, distraction free writing app based on Basecamp&#39;s trix-editor.

I documented the process in a couple blog posts but this was the best one.

The more elaborate version of the above.
