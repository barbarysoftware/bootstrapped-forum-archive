    <title>All the talks from 12 Business of Software Conferences</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/all-the-talks-from-12-business-of-software-conferences/4246</link>
    <description>We&#39;ve pulled all the keynote talks from 12 Business of Software Conferences together so you can see them from one single blog post.

**[All the BoS Keynotes](http://businessofsoftware.org/2016/07/all-talks-from-business-of-software-conferences-in-one-place-saas-software-talks/?utm_medium=P4&amp;utm_source=Bootstrappedfm)**.

Would love to know whether this is a useful resource for this group. We may also do the same for some (or possibly all) of the Lightning Talks. Given we have limited resource, would the Lighting Talks be more useful than sets of talks that relate to, say, marketing, bootstrapping, culture, hiring etc?</description>
