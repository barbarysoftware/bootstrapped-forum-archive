    <title>Hi I&#39;m Chris, a wannabe Freelancer and Bootstrapper in College</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-chris-a-wannabe-freelancer-and-bootstrapper-in-college/1089</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a student at FAU. I&#39;m insanely busy with basically anything I think is interested. I envy not being in college only because of the focus on what you&#39;re doing. I also do enjoy the variety of people and even the craziness of the whole experience.

I want to get my self going with a good freelancing business as well as launch my new website http://realday.co which is still in heavy alpha stage. It&#39;s being created with Bootstrap, Laravel, and jQuery :grin:

I&#39;m excited to be part of a community like this and learn more about bootstrapping a (couple) business(es). :wink: </description>
