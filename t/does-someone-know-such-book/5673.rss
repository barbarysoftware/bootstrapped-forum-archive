    <title>Does someone know such book</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/does-someone-know-such-book/5673</link>
    <description>A few years ago I found a self-publishing web site with mostly IT books. There was a book from an IT auditor which described four architectural patterns that he have observed in every successful application that he have audited in his career.

Unfortunately I cannot remember now neither the web site nor the book (thought it was Packtub, but it&#39;s not)

Does someone know this book or such site (Googling doesn&#39;t helped me) ?</description>
