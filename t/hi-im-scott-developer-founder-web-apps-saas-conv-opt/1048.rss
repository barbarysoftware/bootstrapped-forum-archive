    <title>Hi,I&#39;m Scott. Developer/Founder (Web, Apps, SaaS, Conv. Opt.)</title>

    <description>I&#39;m Scott Underwood when I&#39;m not working on client work (Websites, Web Apps, SaaS, WP plugins, Conversion Optimization and custom marketing funnels)  I&#39;m working on my own projects. 

2014 is the year I&#39;m launching my own products. I&#39;m working on my own SaaS app (ProjectMatches.com) and have a few other ideas I&#39;ll be rolling out this year.

I&#39;m a big fan of Rob Walling, Patio11, Amy Hoy, Brennan Dunn and Nathan Barry and hope to duplicate some of their success with products.

I enjoy technology, the web and online business and enjoy chatting it up about all three.

Great to meet you.
