    <description>Hey, Bootstrappers! I am Rich, maker of [Failory](https://www.failory.com), a side-project in which I publish interviews with failed and successful entrepreneurs. A few months ago I decided to began to share Failory numbers and strategies openly. Today, I have just published June report.

Check it out to learn about the marketing strategies I carried out, the project monthly numbers, a revenue &amp; expenses report and my objectives for next month.

But in case you don&#39;t have time to read it all, here are some of the key points:

Many great things happened in June. The three most important were:

- Our [interview with James Rose](https://www.failory.com/mistakes/content-snare) went viral on Hacker News.
- Our [interview with Shanti Braford](https://www.failory.com/interview/phez) also went viral on HN

            <p>Hey! So sorry for my big delay <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> I started the project around 10 months ago. The launch meant 600 subscribers. Our eBook launch meant another 500 subscribers. Around 2,000 subscribers were caused by a few of our interviews getting viral on Hacker News and Reddit. The other 1,900 are from SEO traffic and other communities.</p>

            <p>No, we don’t track any data except for macOS version and language. HN is definitely not uniform compared to something like PH and you’ll find all kinds of people there.</p>
<p>Also it’s more development-centered than entrepreneur-centered. But even when entrepreneurship-related discussions arise, many business owners are just too busy to comment (this is a big problem in communities like Indie Hackers and /r/Entrepreneur).</p>

<p>After each HN spike, did your ongoing monthly sales noticeably increase, compared to before the spike?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Hard to say because the first time it was recently launched and the second time I was doing lots of other promotion and SEO. But when you hit 250-300 points, there’s a 2-3 months tail of people coming from multiple newsletters based on the top HN submissions.</p>
<p>HN literally bootstrapped our business because on its own the app was making $750-1,200 monthly in the first year. It would be much harder to work on it full-time without the initial boost.</p>

<p>On a few occasions I heard “HN first page brought my lots of traffic, but no conversions”.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’ve seen this first hand. My friend’s site spent a few hours in HN position <span class="hashtag">#1</span>. He got a ton of traffic but negligible sales from it. It was sobering to observe.</p>
<p>However I can see HN traffic being useful for a site like Failory, which doesn’t seem to sell directly to visitors.</p>
<p>A problem with the “front page of HN” strategy (as well as the related “lots of Reddit upvotes” strategy or “<span class="hashtag">#1</span> on Product Hunt” strategy), even if it does lead to sales, is the traffic is fleeting. You get no traffic yesterday, a ton of traffic today, and almost no traffic tomorrow. Much, much better for most of us is a marketing strategy that leads to solid, ongoing traffic.</p>

            <p>Waouh. What a strong opinion on HN.</p>
<p>HN provides a huge traffic, in this traffic, lots of people have side projects / even “eternal wannabi’s”.<br>
It’s the perfect audience for developer tools / SaaS for SMBs !</p>

<p>high quality traffic (i.e developers &amp; entrepreneurs from HN )</p>

</aside>
<p>AFAIK, HN is not a high quality traffic. It is a bunch of eternal wannabi’s, most of whom do not ever move a finger.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the report, it’s really interesting to see those numbers.</p>
<p>Those are great numbers imho, I’m sure you will be able to monetise this traffic.</p>
<p>One idea: Since you have high quality traffic (i.e developers &amp; entrepreneurs from HN ) you could add a “Tool” part in your interviews, where people talk about the most important tools that helped them, and get paid through referral programs or PPC ?</p>
<p>As a frequent reader of your website, I don’t care about affiliate links and referrals, but I would hate to see ads!</p>

            <p>Hey, Bootstrappers! I am Rich, maker of <a href="https://www.failory.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Failory</a>, a side-project in which I publish interviews with failed and successful entrepreneurs. A few months ago I decided to began to share Failory numbers and strategies openly. Today, I have just published June report.</p>
<p>Check it out to learn about the marketing strategies I carried out, the project monthly numbers, a revenue &amp; expenses report and my objectives for next month.</p>

<p>I went on a trip in June so I didn't have a lot of time to work on the project this month. Anyway, two interviews went viral on Hacker News, which is the main reason of why Failory got 67,657 page views and 302 new email subscribers. Moreover, I...</p>
