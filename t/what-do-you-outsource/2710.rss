    <title>What do you outsource?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/what-do-you-outsource/2710</link>
    <description>As a growing bootstrapper, I&#39;m thinking about the best ways to put money to work to either increase sanity or sales or customer satisfaction, etc.

I&#39;m curious - for the bootstrapped and profitable out there, what are the things that you&#39;re most happy with having outsourced?  Could be anything from hiring a house cleaner to outsourcing support, marketing, or bookkeeping, to hiring a sales person, etc.

And it doesn&#39;t have to be something that you&#39;re hiring someone for specifically. Maybe it&#39;s a SaaS or app you&#39;re paying for. But basically anything where you&#39;re trading money for time. 

Thanks!</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I run a small PHP dev shop so ignoring the obvious developers &amp; project management:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounts. Initially just end of year accounts, then book keeping &amp; payroll, now invoicing, chasing payment, setting annual budgets, updating cashflow, setting pricing, working with PM to analyse time-sheets to ensure we’re billing for everything, ditto inefficiencies. This has definitely been a huge time saver for me and we’re billing more and earning more margin</li>
<li>PA 20 hours per week, mostly from home but in the office 4 hrs per week. Life saver; I only wish I had done this sooner</li>
<li>Copywriting - one who understands marketing</li>
<li>PPC - just started so we’ll see if it is successful</li>
<li>Housekeeper &amp; nanny - 2pm - 6pm so my wife &amp; I can come home from our respective work at normal times and my kids still get fed</li>
<li>Web Ops - the only bit of tech I still enjoy doing myself, but I don’t have the time to do it justice</li>
</ul>
<p>Next:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mentoring / mastermind</li>
<li>SEO - once I’ve done a bit of work myself to understand what contemporary best practices are</li>
<li>Support (from this thread, thanks!)</li>
</ul>

            <p>The one thing I have learned over the years about outsourcing is this:</p>
<p>Never outsource something you don’t understand.</p>
<p>We outsourced our CPA / tax filing and didn’t understand it, only to find out (after getting audited) that our CPA was giving us terrible advice. It was only after reading a book on small business taxes myself that we were able to find a really good CPA that was affordable and knows what she is doing. (The IRS agents refer to the CPA as the “Can’t Pass Again” exam because most CPAs are terrible).</p>
<p>We’ve outsourced a number of other things over the years, and the same rule always holds true.</p>
<p>Understand something fully before you outsource it. That’s the only way you will know that they are doing their job correctly.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes–it is absolutely the thing you need to do (document and create processes).  But there are limits to this.  For example, with my WordPress plugins there are integrations we support and those 3rd party plugins have limits or quirks I can’t fix or create a process for.  Often, I’ll create an FAQ article for it–but I still have to answer that question 3x a week (my support volume is about 1000 emails/month, more or less–anything I can do to reduce it is helpful)</p>
<p>That’s an example of what I meant above.  It’s process-documented and there’s no more value in my participating in the conversation anymore.  Create the FAQ, tell someone when to answer the question with it, and boom–move on.</p>

            <p>I’m sure you probably have more experience than I do with this, and my support volume is still fairly low, but I think the “daily same-questin, same response” is exactly the pain that I want to feel in order to know what areas of the app / documentation need to be improved.</p>

<p>But when you’ve spent the last month answering the same questions several times a week, it’s time to look for a process to solve that problem IMO</p>

<p>You can still get that input without the grind of the daily same-question, same-response by periodically injecting yourself into the process, but still have someone else do the primary task of responding.</p>
<p>I agree that at an early stage, outsourcing is the wrong solution.  But when you’ve spent the last month answering the same questions several times a week, it’s time to look for a process to solve that problem IMO.</p>

            <p>I might feel differently if we had more “tech” and less “support”. But often it’s more support oriented. Folks are confused or something. And as soon as we see something we can do to avoid more of the same calls, we just do that.</p>

            <p>I outsource a lot of stuff now. It’s taken me some time to learn how to vet someone but it’s an evergreen skill.</p>
<p>I outsource:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programming (after a LOT of vetting and trying several programmers)</li>
<li>Graphic Design</li>
<li>website design (I tweak and maintain it myself)</li>
<li>copywriting <em>assistance</em>  (I do the copywriting myself but get help from one or two other folks)</li>
</ul>
<p>That gives me more time for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Usability studies. These are INCREDIBLY useful and helps with the A/B testing below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A/B testing (both on Adwords and our landing pages).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working on LifeCycle Emails  (tips, etc. via email)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working on an email “course” in our field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tech Support. I’ve never outsources Tech Support b/c it provides such an opportunity for UX feedback.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The key for outsourcing customer support is to train well, document well, guide well, and monitor well. You can’t just say, “Hey you, please do my customer support!”</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This.  A thousand times over.  Tier 1 support for my plugins isn’t hard to document and train someone on.  I have clear points when it needs to be handed off to a developer for more in depth analysis.  So I just trained them using that philosophy and it’s worked well on both plugins.  They spend about 3-10 hours a week answering forum questions, each.  Saves me tons of time.</p>
<p>And a similar thing with Twitter follower management–I’ve used a VA in the Philippines to grow my followers from 18 to 670 in the span of a year.  I use TweetAdder to do that and I wrote a document for her to use, how to find the “right” followers, what to do to get them, and so on.  I use Buffer to tweet the articles and I barely spend 10 min a day on that, if that.</p>

            <p>Re: support. When looking for support help in the past, one place we’ve found success is with our existing users. If you have someone who is already volunteering their time on your support forums or some other channel, hiring them to do some front line support can cut out a lot of time in training, etc, as they already know your product and have a rapport with your customers.</p>

            <p>i don’t think there’s an “easy” way to outsourcing custuomer support. I just hired someone remote part time and trained them for about a month, created also a bunch of “process” documents describing how to act in each situation, wrote canned messages, etc. but as others have said, it made a HUGE impact in my quality of life (I do have a big customer support load).</p>

            <p>Finding the right people to whom to outsource is hard - and this includes support help. I’m afraid I have no wonderful tips about how to make this easier.</p>
<p>I found my customer support agent through my personal network.</p>

            <p>Customer support. This was the biggest win I had from outsourcing.</p>
<p>I wish I had done this years earlier. It turns out that other people can do this as well as me. Or 90% as well. Or even 110% as well as I do it. It frees me up so much to do other business things.</p>
<p>The key for outsourcing customer support is to train well, document well, guide well, and monitor well. You can’t just say, “Hey you, please do my customer support!”</p>

            <p>Logo design (sometimes)<br>
Accounting<br>
Customer support (although I jump in sometimes)<br>
Some research or manual work that is easily explainable, easy to do but takes a lot of time.<br>
Lately I’ve also been looking for a web developer but that’d be more “hiring someone” than outsourcing.</p>

            <p>Tougher design work and… less than I should.</p>
<p>I have this idea of a renaissance man in my head that I like to try to be, which can be a curse. On the plus side, I can calculate/perform payroll by hand in minutes, custom build racks of servers, rebuild an engine, do basic electrical/plumbing, etc. I have probably “wasted” untold hours on it all, which isn’t as cool to say.</p>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/daverodenbaugh">@daverodenbaugh</a>!</p>
<p>Twitter account management - how did that work out?</p>
<p>Tier 1 support - how did that work out?  I’m playing with the idea of outsourcing support but I’d want the quality to be reallllly good.  99% of the tier 1 stuff I see drives me insane.</p>
<p>House cleaning - good call.  This is something I have a hard time with philosophically but also heard it on zenfounder the other day and it makes sense.</p>
