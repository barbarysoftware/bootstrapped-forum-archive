            <p>I was on a system of getting about 4 hours sleep, drinking lots of mt dew, lasting through the week, then crashing on the weekends sleeping for long nights, naps through the weekend days etc. It was a bad and unhealthy sleep cycle, dependent on too much caffeine.</p>
<p>I switched and tried polyphasic sleeping, where i would sleep 4 hours at night (12 - 4am) then i would take four 20min naps during the day (8am, 12-noon, 4pm, 8pm(sometimes)) and it was amazing how refreshed i was all the time. The key is training yourself to fall asleep fast, and go deep for the nap period.</p>
<p>That was working out well, then I adopted a baby - and that threw everything <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> haha</p>
<p>Now I sleep 10 - 6am and it’s fine. I’ll go back to polyphasic soon, once i get back into comfortably exercising, and the baby start’s sleeping more at night.</p>
<p>Just trying to get every minute out of the day.</p>

            <p>I’ve tried it all. Late nights, early mornings and a little of each.</p>
<p>I find there are benefits, esp if you have kids. If you don’t, then this may not be an answer for you. Age is, I’m sure, a factor. I’m 44 and full-time employed.</p>
<p>I went through a period of getting up daily at 5 AM and going to bed between 9-10 pm.  It gave me nearly 2 hours of time in the morning and when I was coding it felt like I got a lot done.  I did that for over a year but eventually just couldn’t do it any more.</p>
<p>I have been doing late-ish nights (I usually get to bed by 11-11:30 PM)  and with kids I’ve found this best (assuming you can get them to bed at a decent hour).  The bad part is being tired from a long work day, but you can sleep in and stay up perhaps later depending on your morning routine.</p>
<p>I’ve also burned the candle at both ends and, while you can maintain that for awhile, I almost always hit a wall and have to take a few nights of major catch-up sleep.  Plus I don’t feel super productive during those times so it’s probably a net loss.</p>
<p>My current winner is late nights and waking around 6 AM for an hour or so.  For me, it only requires one reset day a week to maintain.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I get up as early as possible before my wife and kids. At one point in time I had a good hour or two of uninterrupted productive time before anyone else got up. Ever since we had our second kid, who is now 10 months old, I’ve had a harder time getting up as early, but I’m slowly ratcheting up my wake-up time. (It’s currently 6:15.)</p>
<p>I read a really memorable quote in the book Get Clients Now! by C.J. Hayden: “Sleep deprivation is not good time management.” It’s kind of hard to argue with that logic when you put it that way.</p>
<p>I also read a whole <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harvard-Medical-School-Nights-Guides/dp/0071467432/ref=sr_1_11?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1395020935&amp;sr=1-11&amp;keywords=get%20a%20good%20night%27s%20sleep" rel="nofollow noopener">book on sleep</a> and according to the author there really is such a thing called “sleep debt.” So if you normally require 8 hours a night but you only sleep 5 one night, you “owe” yourself 3 hours of sleep and you’re really just robbing Peter to pay Paul because you eventually have to make up the time anyway.</p>
<p>Having said all that, having kids screws up everything, and my sleep habits these days aren’t very good.</p>

            <p>I sleep 2 times. First - 4-6 hours at night (have to stay up till ~3 am since I’m in Europe and most of my customers are in the States). Plus a day nap for 1-2 hours.</p>

            <p>As I’ve gotten older, I’ve found that I want and need more sleep and that I’m less able to tolerate major deviations from that requirement, and I’m trying to listen to my body.  Usually it’s 6-7 hours.  Less than 5 will seriously cut into my ability to think the next day as will 8 or more.</p>

            <p>I’m in a similar boat to the rest of you. I really need 7-8 hours to be at peak performance.</p>
<p>I will say though, that I can do less for a couple nights in a row (like 5-6) and still seem okay, but then it catches up with me and I crash. Not worth the crash, so I just try to put in the proper time.</p>

            <p>I try to get 7-8 hours. I think not getting enough sleep is counter productive. But some people seem to need less than others. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously used to only need a few hours a night. But then, she wasn’t human. ;0)</p>

            <p>I get about 8 hours, until the twins wake me up. I’m looking to get into a bit of an early rising habit, but I think I’m still catching up from the first year of parenthood.</p>
<p>I used to be a night owl for working, but I’ve found the stuff—code, writing, whatever—that I’d produce would generally turn out to be crap!</p>

            <p>I’ve never needed more than about 6 hours (it’s not yet 6am in the UK and I’m ploughing through email while trying to stop a giant orange cat dipping his tail in my coffee). I don’t nap or think “having a lie in” is a nice idea - it just gives me a headache.</p>
<p>I did make an effort to retrain myself out of being a night owl to become an early riser as I found that late in the evening I was just messing about and not getting stuff done, when I get up early I’m very productive. I wrote most of my recent book before 7am in the mornings. Most days I have cleared my inbox, been for a run (I’m marathon training), and sorted my daily GTD lists before 9. So as well as how much sleep (you can’t do a lot about what you need) I think it is important to look at when you are most productive and maximize that time.</p>
<p>For example. It’s hard to do a full days work then come home and start work on a side project - you might be better to go to bed an hour earlier and relax in the evenings but get up early and give the side project an hour then.</p>

            <p>I get about 3-4 hours uninterrupted sleep and 6-8 total. If you want to sleep less you must take naps during the day, no more than 30 minutes or you’ll be groggy.  There isn’t a safe way to get less sleep and be more productive.</p>

            <p>I struggle with sleep. Nowadays I seem to have a tough time truly getting 4+ hours of uninterrupted sleep, but overall it’s about 8 hours of “sleep”. The more times I wake up the less productive I am. If I actually get less than 7 hours of overall sleep then I know I will be lucky to get 1 hour of productive work that day.</p>

            <p>I get about 8 hours a night.  I am able to measure it with my Fitbit and the quality of sleep is pretty good as well.</p>

            <p>I used to only sleep about 5-6 interrupted hours <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I’ve been making a real effort to get more lately though so up to around 7-8 (sometimes still interrupted by kids). You do feel a world of difference. It’s a lot to balance with a business and 3 kids so especially as you get older you have to try and make time to sleep. One of the big downsides of the work anytime anyplace world of software.</p>

            <p>8-9 hours.</p>
<p>Any less and I’m way less productive.</p>
<p>I started using eye blinders/covers to get better sleep.</p>

            <p>I sleep more to get more done. If I haven’t slept enough everything will seem harder than it is, and I’ll be cranky all day. Not worth it.</p>
<p>I usually sleep about 7 hours per night.</p>
