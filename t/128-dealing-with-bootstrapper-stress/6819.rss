    <description>Bootstrapping is stressful. I share seven ways I try to manage the stress of being a software bootstrapper.

            <p>Thanks so much for the episode, it makes me feel that stress-free bootstrapping is still possible <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I have a question though. Sometimes I hear and read in some books that growing fast and trying to dominate the market at any cost is a vital necessity for a modern business because of competition. That is if a business doesn’t scale fast enough, it’s a question of time when the competitors kick the business out of the market. So they think that the only correct way to survive <em>in the long run</em> is to grow as fast as possible that obviously means a lot of stress. What do you think about that?</p>

            <p>I never promise any new features to my customers (I sell a standard desktop product). They should only buy it when they  feel the product in its current state suits their needs. This ensures I can take all the time I need to add new functionality, and hence keep the product very stable. This reduces stress enormously.</p>

            <p>Steve,</p>
<p>great episode, thank you for sharing.</p>
<p>For me a great stress relieve is an established routine that helps me get out of the house at nights like joining a sports league.</p>

            <p>Friends, experienced this on my own and digging deeply by participating in many studies (NLP, EFT, Bowen therapy, meditations, etc.) the best I can offer you is the technique of Andrea Freddie TAI <a href="https://www.ilgiardinodeilibri.it/webinar/webinar-gratuito-tecniche-di-alchimia-interiore-con-andrea-fredi">https://www.ilgiardinodeilibri.it/webinar/webinar-gratuito-tecniche-di-alchimia-interiore-con-andrea-fredi</a><br>
and my book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clear-your-Subconscious-Mind-practical-ebook/dp/B07NYK2C8C">https://www.amazon.com/Clear-your-Subconscious-Mind-practical-ebook/dp/B07NYK2C8C</a> all other things are just temporary solutions.</p>
<p>… I forget to mention Hooponopono but it will require at least 100 hours of practice.</p>
<p>This is becoming a business by the way, see Shaolin Temple in PWC <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GnOGlafa3Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GnOGlafa3Q</a></p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/stevemcleod">@SteveMcLeod</a> Enjoyed this podcast very much.</p>
<p>For me one thing to reduce stress was to use a reseller (fastspring) instead of stripe:  No (less) hassle with VAT and tax authorities  in the EU, Russia, AU, now US states coming …</p>
<p>The podcast ties nicely in with <a href="https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/23-rules-to-run-a-software-startup-with-minimum-hassle/6789" class="inline-onebox">23 rules to run a software startup with minimum hassle</a></p>
