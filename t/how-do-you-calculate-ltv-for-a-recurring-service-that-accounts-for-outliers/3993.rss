    <title>How do you calculate LTV for a Recurring service that accounts for outliers?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-do-you-calculate-ltv-for-a-recurring-service-that-accounts-for-outliers/3993</link>
    <description>We&#39;ve been testing a Subscription version of our software for a few years now.

I went in and calculated what I think our LTV per customer is.  
I looked at a group of customers who subscribed in 2013 and then looked at their lifetime value ...so far.
So I calculated total months, total revenue and then divided by number of customers.

BUT... here&#39;s the kicker:
About 6% of those users are **still subscribe**d. They could stay subscribed **forever**.
I don&#39;t have enough data to predict that (based on the math I know :slight_smile:


Any suggestions?</description>

            <p>True, but I run the risk of missing marketing opportunities. (As you have suggested, I am usually very conservative, but that can lead to missing opportunities)</p>
<p>Let’s say my conservative LTV is $100 but the true value is $200. And I find that Adwords costs $110 per paying customer.<br>
If I use the conservative number, I’ll never advertise.  But I might miss out on nearly doubling every dollar of advertising I put into it.</p>
<p>And… I was calculating LTV wrong. <a class="mention" href="/u/pjc">@pjc</a> correctly pointed out that I need to base it on Churn rate.</p>

            <p>Why worry about the outliers? Use your calculated LTV number as a “good enough” number - you’ll be erring on the side of being conservative with it, which will prevent overspending on acquiring customers, etc.</p>
