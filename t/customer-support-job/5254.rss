    <description>***If this post is inappropriate please remove***

Im trying to help my stepfather out with a remote customer support position.

He has recently moved with my mum to Australia and has sold his courier business in South Africa and wants to put his skills to use again.

He has vast experience in customer support through his courier business and prior to that was a marketing manager for an international plastics company.

He would be looking for a remote support role. 

He has already taken a look at remote.co and weworkremotely.com and applied for a few jobs. He is open to working on a trial basis.

Any suggestions welcome.</description>
