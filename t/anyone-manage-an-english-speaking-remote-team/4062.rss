    <title>Anyone manage an english speaking remote team?</title>

    <description>Hey There,

If you manage a remote team I would love to chat with you!

I&#39;m developing an idea that has the potential to make remote team asynchronous communication way easier and more effective.

So, if you think that your teams communication has room for improvement, and you would like to have a fun conversation with me :wink: please PM me and let&#39;s setup a time/date to chat.

Thanks,
Justin</description>

            <p>I don’t manage one but I’m part of one where we collaborate on various tasks. We use Wrike for this. I am not sure if the group admin would want to migrate at the moment given we have only recently paid for a yearly subscription, but I would really be interested to understand how you make collaboration better.</p>
