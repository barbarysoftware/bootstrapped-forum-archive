    <title>How am I going to use sports fans to drive 140k monthly traffic to my website?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-am-i-going-to-use-sports-fans-to-drive-140k-monthly-traffic-to-my-website/7291</link>
    <description>This is my website with over 20,000 icons in a bundle, that I&#39;ve been working on for over 4 years now - Flat-Icons(dot)com

Some time ago I bought this website, which has 140k UV per month - Teamcolorcodes(dot)com
It shows the color palette of your favorite sports team.

Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t have time to make anything out of it. 
I have some ideas, like a sticky bar offering freebie icons, but other than that, not much.

Any ideas?</description>
