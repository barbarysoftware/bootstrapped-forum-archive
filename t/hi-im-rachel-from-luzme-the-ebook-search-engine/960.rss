    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Rachel from Luzme, the ebook search engine</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-rachel-from-luzme-the-ebook-search-engine/960</link>
    <description>Luzme is an ebook search engine which 

 - Helps you buy the ebooks you want when they&#39;re cheap
 - Tells you when your favourite authors release new ebooks

I started it as a side-project some years ago to solve a problem I had of how to find and buy the ebooks I wanted; I&#39;m now working on turning it into my full-time business, bootstrapping it as a solo founder.

I had a great boost in November when I found an article about it on the frontpage of cnet.com :) It took 2 years to get the first thousand signups, and 2 weeks for the 2nd!

So now I&#39;m trying to figure out how to make that kind of coverage happen some more. And write the app. And cover more countries and more stores. And add more features...

            <p>Hey, that’s really cool! So you might be interested in trying out my service for authors, which would send you alerts when that happened… I’ve been running a beta version for the last year, and am about to redesign and relaunch that.</p>
<p>Yes, the UI is much better. A real shame that the <a href="http://cnet.com" rel="nofollow noopener">cnet.com</a> surge happened 2 weeks before I was ready with the new UI!</p>
<p>Still, since folk have been signing up when the site is too slow and the UI was ugly, then I reckon that’s some good validation that I might be doing something useful <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Hi Rachael,</p>
<p>I’ve used Luzme occasionally in the past. I see you have improved your UI a lot.</p>
<p>Just for interest, how do you fund the site? Using affliate links?</p>
<p>PS- I am also an published author. I just checked my book, an saw Apple has reduced my price without asking me! Need to have a word with them. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
