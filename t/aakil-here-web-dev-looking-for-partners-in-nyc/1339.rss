Hi there!

I&#39;m a web dev trying to build some profit from side projects. I quit my full time in December and have been freelancing/contracting while working on side projects. I&#39;m down for non-technical work as well: whatever makes the product work.

Would love to work with some people in the NYC area. Open to all skill sets.

I have a few side projects still ticking, but I&#39;m not really as excited about them as I was when I first started:
gemsinthejungle.com, codeharmony.net, sharebuttongenerator.aakilfernandes.com


And I recently sold one for a small amount:
pitchboom.com

Down to try just about anything. However I&#39;d like to work on something that could generate revenue within a month of launching. Lately my minds been drifting to a social network for bootstrappers, and an &quot;outsource your job search&quot; type service.

Heads up, I have a contract for the next 1-3 weeks that should keep me pretty busy. After that I&#39;d be open to working on something full time.</description>
