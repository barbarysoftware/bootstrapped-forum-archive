    <title>Hello, I&#39;m Greg. I&#39;m learning how to build and sell things</title>

    <description>Hi All, I&#39;ve been lurking around for the past few weeks and decided to introduce myself. My name is Greg and I&#39;m marketer/MBA/nerd who lives in southwest New Hampshire. I know enough Ruby/Rails to be dangerous but I wouldn&#39;t consider myself to be a web developer (yet).

Over the last few months I&#39;ve been building an educational product in my spare time. I&#39;ve learned a lot in the process and have even managed to make a little over $500 in pre-sales. Once things are up and running, I believe that it will turn into a nice little income stream that takes minimal maintenance. I&#39;ve considered blogging about my process.

I&#39;m also a co-founder of [contract building software](http://www.gethourglass.com/) called Hourglass. My partner and are I starting to see some steadier traffic (~2k/month) and are looking to launch and optimize over the next couple months.

I&#39;m excited to join the community and look forward to learning as much as I can.</description>

            <p>Ian, thanks for the good advice. For now, I definitely try and limit my programming studying time. I agree and think it’s more important to focus on products that pay.</p>

            <p>Awesome Greg, welcome aboard! Being a great programmer is only important later, early on making something that is useful is most important.</p>
