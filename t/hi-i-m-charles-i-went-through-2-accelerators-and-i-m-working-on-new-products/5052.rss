    <description>Hey guys, my name is Charles and I live in Vancouver, Canada. On Twitter, I&#39;m [@charleshanCOM](https://twitter.com/charleshanCOM).

I studied computer engineering at the University of British Columbia and right after graduation, I co-founded Orosim, virtual training for healthcare professionals. About three months in, we were accepted to e@UBC Accelerator Program and after another three months, we got into Boost VC, biggest accelerator for blockchain and VR (Yes, it&#39;s in Silicon Valley).

(Fast forward two years)
I wish I could be sharing how my company is now a unicorn but that&#39;s not my story. Long story short, it is dead (Man it hurts saying this).

I love making products so I&#39;m going to continue my journey with a new approach. I&#39;ll be launching multiple products in the upcoming weeks and share my experience along the way.

Currently, I&#39;m working on [Sketchcase](https://www.sketchcase.com) (Whiteboard sticker for laptop lids) and UserMap (I&#39;d love to see everyone on Bootstrapped.fm on a map).

Looking forward to connecting with everyone!</description>

<p>I assume the sticker must have a hole made in the center, or other people in the coffee shop won’t see that the owner has an Apple laptop. That would be simply unacceptable. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>What a great idea!  I instantly like it.<br>
Also smart to segment to mac users, as this keeps your production easier (but excludes me).</p>
<p>Have you tried outsourcing the production to someone with an automatic cutter?</p>
<p>Regarding reaching out to retail:  Before that I’d look into trademark / protection and then try to sell a license to a bigger producer.</p>

            <p>Oh wow, there seems to have been quite a “Hacker News moment” in January, right?</p>
<p>I think it is good that you are doing everything yourself at this stage, that keeps costs low and your operation lean and mean.</p>

            <p>Thanks Holger! Inventory and shipping are all done in-house. Manufacturing (I buy the roll and cut it to custom sizes), packaging, and shipping using ShipStation + Canada Post + USPS.</p>

<p>I had a pretty good start but I’m having trouble continuing to reach out to potential customers. My next step will be reaching out to resellers/retail.</p>

            <p>Hi Charles,<br>
welcome!</p>
<p>Curious since your Whiteboard sticker project is based something physical - how do you do the inventory/shipping?<br>
Are you using a dropshipping partner or do you own your inventory?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
