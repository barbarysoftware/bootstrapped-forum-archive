    <title>LTV Conf Brighton 19th April</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/ltv-conf-brighton-19th-april/4720</link>
    <description>Hey,

@andycroll and I are organising the 2nd Life. Time. Value Conference in Brighton, England on Wednesday 19th April.

It&#39;s a one day single-track conference in Brighton for 160 people who don&#39;t want to spend their working lives trading time for money.

This year&#39;s LTV Conf speakers (all bootstrapped) include:

- Amy Hoy (@amyhoy), Founder http://letsfreckle.com and https://unicornfree.com/
- Brennan Dunn (@brennandunn) , Founder http://doubleyourfreelancing.com
- Bridget Harris, Founder http://YouCanBook.me
- Laura Elizabeth, Founder http://lauraelizabeth.co/client-portal/
- Thomas Smale, Founder http://feinternational.com
- Stef Lewandowski, Founder http://makelight.com

Early Bird Tickets are on sale until midnight 31st January.

You can grab your ticket here: http://ti.to/ltvconf/2017

We also have a limited number of places to master classes on the 18th April. We&#39;ll have 8 people on a &#39;starting&#39; track working to get their businesses off the ground and well on the way to £10K MRR. And 8 people on a &#39;scaling&#39; track who are working to grow their businesses well beyond £100K MRR.

This conference is inspired by the awesome experiences I&#39;ve had at @robwalling @MarkLittlewood&#39;s conferences but we wanted to do something smaller and closer to home. If you only go to one conference this year, I recommend you go to one of theirs: http://microconf.com or http://businessofsoftware.com. If you can&#39;t make it to either and fancy a trip to the UK&#39;s south coast please do join us.

Hope you can make it,

Jon</description>
