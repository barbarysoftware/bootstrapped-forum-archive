    <title>Do you have experience outsourcing customer support?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/do-you-have-experience-outsourcing-customer-support/1834</link>
    <description>Did it work? Why?

I&#39;m specially interested in people that have done it or are still doing it in SAAS products and/or e-commerce sites.</description>

            <p>We’re based in the UK, where “overseas” means “in the US” :). So I’m guessing - no, he’s more of a “local”. I posted a job to some local UK, European and Russian developer forums and found a great guy who works for us now.</p>
<p>BTW, it’s the second time we’re hiring someone using small local boards, turned out to be really effective. Requires local language knowledge though <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> Also, a couple of my friends (who’re also founders) were successful finding people through Facebook and Twitter, just shout-out, ask for retweet and they will come.</p>

            <p>Sounds interesting. Where did you end up getting someone from? oDesk, 37signals?</p>
<p>Are they local or overseas based?</p>

            <p>We considered CoSupport briefly. It can get very pricey. Way more expensive than hiring just one or two full-time support guys. Not justifiable for a small company.</p>
<p>But from what I know they are awesome at their jobs. If you can afford it go for it.</p>

            <p>Haven’t done this myself yet, but if I did this is exactly the approach I would take.</p>
<p>Don’t expect them to sink or swim—they need to know your product really, really well before you let them interface with customers.</p>

            <p>Got it.</p>
<p>Do you know about someone that has hired an external service/company (for example, something like <a href="http://cosupport.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">CoSupport</a>) for doing customer support (vs hiring someone)?</p>

            <p>I hope <a class="mention" href="/u/jitbit">@jitbit</a> doesn’t mind me replying to this (I’m a co-founder there). At one point we started getting so much tickets that essentially all we did all day was replying to customers. I was handling most of the tickets and simply couldn’t do anything else when we started getting 20-30 tickets per day.  It was inefficient and we decided to hire someone to do that for us.</p>
<p>The person we hired handles around 70% of all tickets – I handle the rest. Many tickets are too technical, since we make complex web apps. Also, support tickets is a place where I can speak to customers directly and I’m not ready to give that up entirely.</p>

            <p>Nice. All your comments make total sense.</p>
<p>What was the main reason that made you decide to outsource it?</p>

            <p>Yeah, we’re doing it since this winter (I even posted a thread <a href="http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/where-to-post-a-support-job/898/">here</a> ) was doing it all by ourselves (the founders) before that. Since our flagship product (the <a href="http://www.jitbit.com/web-helpdesk/" rel="nofollow noopener">helpdesk</a>) is quite complex, the guy we hired had to spend several weeks learning. We basically told him “do nothing just read our replies for two week”. Then we have created a room in Hipchat where he could post quick tech questions for developers and such…</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t expect support people to learn fast. They’re not you, they don’t know your product very well.</li>
<li>Don’t do this from the start, until the product-market-fit has been established - you should do support yourself, so you can make fast product-strategy decisions.</li>
</ol>
