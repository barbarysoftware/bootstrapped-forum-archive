    <description>Hey! I am Rich Clominson, co-founder of Failory.

A few days ago I had the pleasure to interview Eric Bandholz, founder of Beardbrand, a bootstrapped e-commerce dedicated to the urban beardsman, which is grossing over $100K/month. We talked about his personal, as well as business failures before building his successful e-commerce. He also talked about the mistakes he committed when building and growing his company, described his biggest disadvantages and explained the obstacles he had to overcome.

As a bootstrapper, I have found this interview really useful. [Read it to learn from his mistakes](https://failory.com/mistakes/beardbrand)!</description>
