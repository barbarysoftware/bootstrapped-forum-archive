    <title>CRM Recommendations?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/crm-recommendations/1175</link>
    <description>I&#39;m getting close to (re)launching one of my products. I&#39;m going to be a lot more proactive on sales than I was originally and would like to use a CRM system. I&#39;ve used both SugarCRM and Salesforce at the day job and they both are a bit overkill for my needs. I&#39;m currently looking at Highrise, Nimble, and Insightly. Anybody have any experience with those?

I&#39;m thinking I might pass on Highrise due to 37 Signals selling it off shortly and the fact that I don&#39;t use Basecamp for project management.</description>

            <p>Wow, that’s a beast of a post <a class="mention" href="/u/casjam">@CasJam</a> - very nice.</p>
<p>I’m giving streak a try right now.  I like that it’s integrated into gmail because I’m already very comfortable in there.  So far the UI is decent - seems like it could be polished up a bit.</p>
<p>At this point the main thing that I’m beginning to find is taking up more of my time is follow-up.  I’m trying to be a lot more persistent about follow-up, taking a queue from Steli from <a href="http://close.io" rel="nofollow noopener">close.io</a>.</p>
<p>Up until now I’ve been using a gmail snooze script which helps to at least snooze the conversation until you need to talk next.</p>
<p>Streak does that as well, and it also has a nice page where it shows you all your leads in each stage of the funnel.  I think the trello board view is probably a better visualization / management tool for this than streak though.</p>
<p>I may eventually just automate all of this one way or another, but I’m trying to do the follow-up manually for now because I don’t want it to come off as being annoyingly automated, and I want to get the process down first.</p>
<p>I’ll let you guys know how it goes!</p>

            <p>+1 for <a class="mention" href="/u/casjam">@casjam</a>’s Trello system. Great post to read through. I’ve used that as a base for our system, and it has significantly improved our handling of leads since implementing.</p>

            <p>Trello.</p>
<p>My SaaS relies heavily on inbound phone sales and consultations. Most of our traffic is directed to our “request a consultation” form (Gravity Forms, wordpress plugin).</p>
<p>From there, it goes through Zapier, which connects to Trello.  Creates a card, outputs the lead’s submitted info in a nicely formatted way (using markdown in the description).</p>
<p>In the Trello board, we have a few lists:  New Leads (to contact), Contacted (but didn’t connect), Connected, Promising, Signed Up, Didn’t Sign up.</p>
<p>We use Trello due dates for followup reminders, and every interaction gets a comment on the lead’s card.</p>
<p>I went into much more detail <a href="http://casjam.com/system-for-selling/" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="/u/mikesperanza36">@mikesperanza36</a> – it’s mostly about discipline, rather than the specific tool.  Especially for a bootstrpper just getting started.</p>
<p>I’ve tried a few in the past (Sugar, Salesforce, Highrise) and have been using <a href="https://www.futuresimple.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Base</a> for about a year.  Their free version does everything I need and I find it both elegant and easy to use (important for that discipline). It has a chrome plugin that automatically turns a LinkedIn profile into a lead, and that saves me a load of typing.</p>
<p>Several of the tools in this thread look great too, but I’m happy with Base &amp; it’s a pain to switch.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I think this conversation would be more useful if people specified whether the kind of sales they were doing. “CRM” is a broad term that can imply a lot of different functionality for different phases of a customer (deal pipeline vs pre-sales support), the types of contact (in-person vs phone vs social media) and for different types of sales methods (high touch vs self-serve).</p>

            <p>Streak looks really cool. The only turn-off for me on first glance is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Streak is currently free while in Beta and there will always be a free plan. In the future, Streak will offer paid premium features, stay tuned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the fact that they’re investor-backed and based in San Francisco. That makes me think they’re just shooting for an acquisition, not a long-term business.</p>

            <p>Hi Kartik,</p>
<p>An opportunity is short for a “sales opportunity”. Some CRMs refer to this as a “deal”.<br>
If you’d like to talk more about the product and your needs, please drop me a private message.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Mike</p>

            <p>Full disclosure: I work at <a href="https://www.pipelinedeals.com/?utm_source=bootstrapped.fm&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=crm-recos" rel="nofollow noopener">PipelineDeals</a></p>
<p>With that said, I believe it will standup to any of the tools recommended. So much about a CRM is preference and workflow. If you can’t support your existing process with a certain tool, get a new one, but don’t let the tool dictate how you work.</p>
<p>Pricing is typically $24/user/month. However, we’re offering <a href="https://www.pipelinedeals.com/bootstrap/?utm_source=bootstrapped.fm&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=crm-recos" rel="nofollow noopener">bootstrapped companies a free account</a>. I thought it was particularly useful for this crowd.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Cool product! I’m looking around for CRM tools for our 2-person bootstrapped startup and your offer looks pretty sweet. The only thing that I don’t understand (forgive me for being a CRM n00b) is what an “opportunity” constitutes. Pretty much everything else seems self-explanatory to me, just not sure what that’s referring to.</p>
<p>Anyway, kudos on a pretty awesome product!</p>

            <p>I’d recommend my product <a href="http://www.clevertim.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Clevertim CRM</a>, but of course I’m biased. That’s probably one of the few where you might be able to influence the roadmap if you need something <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Nimble is more geared towards social CRM, Insightly is big in their gmail integration.<br>
I think the starting point is to define your business processes, workflow, that’ll translate into a set of must have features. Then give some CRMs a try and see how close they’re mapped onto what you want to do. If you start with a CRM solution, you’ll be forced in their way of doing things.<br>
Ultimately, a successful CRM is more about discipline than about the actual tools.</p>

            <p>On the topic of Highrise, they didn’t specifically say that they were going to sell it off, though that was <a href="http://37signals.com" rel="nofollow noopener">one of the possible scenarios</a>. Considering Highrise is something of a flagship product for them, I’d expect it to see a better fate—probably given a dedicated team, with 37Signals retaining partial ownership.  So while the fate of Highrise does come with a few question marks, I wouldn’t assume it’s already headed down the road of, say, Sparrow.app.</p>

            <p>I’ve had a lot of people recommend <a href="https://www.zoho.com/crm/" rel="nofollow noopener">Zoho</a> CRM to me, so that’s what we were using until I switched over to Infusionsoft for our efforts.  Zoho was a well put together product - and it was Free for one user.</p>
<p>I’ve also used <a href="https://getbase.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Base</a> CRM which is pretty nice and free but requires upgrades to unlock most of the useful features.  They also have a proposal generator that feeds into Base automatically.</p>
<p>I’ve also used social CRM’s like Nimble, Contactually, Gist and Batchbook but honestly I never quite understood how to make the most of them.</p>
<p>If I can answer any questions about the ones I mentioned, please let me know</p>

            <p>I’m getting close to (re)launching one of my products. I’m going to be a lot more proactive on sales than I was originally and would like to use a CRM system. I’ve used both SugarCRM and Salesforce at the day job and they both are a bit overkill for my needs. I’m currently looking at Highrise, Nimble, and Insightly. Anybody have any experience with those?</p>
<p>I’m thinking I might pass on Highrise due to 37 Signals selling it off shortly and the fact that I don’t use Basecamp for project management.</p>
