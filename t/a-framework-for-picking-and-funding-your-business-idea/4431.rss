    <description>Hey everybody,

I wanted to share the framework we used to pick a problem to work on, and the four options we explored to finance our business.  We wanted to be sure that if we were going to spend our time and attention on a project, it would be something we liked that had good chances for being successful (as we defined success).

Here&#39;s the intro:

&gt; How do you decide whether to work on an idea you have? And how do you finance it? These are key questions that every entrepreneur has to answer. Here&#39;s the framework we used to pick a good idea to work on, and the four financing options we explored.

You can read the whole post here:

Would love any feedback or thoughts - always looking to improve an learn  :)
