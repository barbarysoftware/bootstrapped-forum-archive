    <title>Hiring support...again</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hiring-support-again/3625</link>
    <description>Hey guys...so I&#39;m thinking about taking another crack at hiring some help with support (tried a few months ago but ended up throwing in the towel).  I think I learned a few things from the last time that I took a crack at it.

I was looking in the $15/hour range before, and found some people that were pretty good, but I realized that if I&#39;m going to hand off support to someone else, they&#39;re going to have to be amazing.

I also have a better idea of support workload as I&#39;ve been kind of streamlining my support workflow through helpscout, building up documentation, etc.

So I&#39;m thinking about looking in the $25-$30/hour range.  Probably just 5-10 hours for starters.

What do you guys think?  Sound like a good range?

Also I was hoping maybe there was a way other than upwork to find someone?  I&#39;d probably be willing to pay a bit of a premium to just get a great reference that I don&#39;t have to spend a lot of time thinking about, screening, etc.</description>

            <p>When I last looked for a US-based support person, that was a range I looked at and found reasonable candidates on Upwork.</p>
<p>If you want to post a job someplace else, you might try this:  <a href="http://jobs.supportops.co/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://jobs.supportops.co/</a>  It’s a job board for customer support jobs (only).</p>
