    <title>I&#39;m a Wordpress monkey and a wannabe professional RoR developer</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/im-a-wordpress-monkey-and-a-wannabe-professional-ror-developer/1343</link>
    <description>So lovely to meet you!

This forum looks awesome, not in the least because it&#39;s done in Ruby on Rails and Ember. I have a small freelance web development company. Almost all my work is basic Wordpress stuff. Setting up Wordpress sites and doing small fixes for clients.

What I really want to do is make great Ruby on Rails apps (kind of like this one) but I have no idea where to get clients for that, or what apps the market needs.

So I&#39;m here to meet some awesome people who love development as much as I do and passionately believe that great apps can make the world a better place. Oh and I&#39;m from Sweden, the land of meatballs, gooey chocolate cake and [this guy][1].
