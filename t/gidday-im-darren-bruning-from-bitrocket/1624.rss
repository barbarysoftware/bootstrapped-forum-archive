    <description>Hi all,

I&#39;m one of 3 founders of a startup called BitRocket (www.bitrocket.co.nz) based in New Zealand.

We&#39;re working on a personal finance product with a (we hope) interesting twist on data visualisation.

I really enjoy the podcasts &amp; am looking forward to being part of the community here.

Cheers,
Darren.</description>

            <p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>I’m actually based in Tauranga, but I spend half the week in Hamilton where my 2 co-founders are based.<br>
Hamilton seems to have a reasonable number of software business, the ones I know of are mostly design shops or other service providers, not too many start-ups. There is one, MEA Mobile, doing some neat mobile apps.</p>
<p>Tauranga seems to be really trying to foster more of a start-up vibe. There are new shared-office-space facilities popping up, an active tech meet-up scene, and links established to US-based VC firms. It’s an awesome place to live &amp; raise a family, so I have high hopes that the tech scene materialises &amp; hope to get involved myself.</p>
<p>If you’re ever over this way, please get in touch, would be great to show you around &amp; talk start-ups.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Darren.</p>

            <p>Hi Darren</p>
<p>My wife is a Kiwi, so I have visted New Zealand a number of times. Are there many software companies around Hamilton?</p>
