BoS is pricey for a bootstrapper, but I highly recommend it.</description>

            <blockquote>
<p>How do you get value from BoS?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good question. Networking for sure.</p>
<ul>
<li>BoS is small, by intention. This encourages relaxed mingling. Counterintuitively, at large conferences attendees tend to stick with their own colleagues.</li>
<li>Most of the attendees are good at running software businesses. This makes the conversations over meals and drinks really helpful.</li>
<li>The speakers don’t get segregated from the attendees, so you get to speak with them during meals and breaks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore you get plenty of chances to speak to talented people running excellent companies.</p>
<p>An example: At BoS Europe this year, I had the chance to chat directly with the founder of Paddle. He was surprisingly candid about his company. He gave me some advice about how I could improve my B2B SaaS’s payment page.</p>
