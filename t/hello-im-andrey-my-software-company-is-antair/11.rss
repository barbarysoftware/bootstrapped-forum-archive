    <title>Hello. I&#39;m Andrey. My software company is Antair</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hello-im-andrey-my-software-company-is-antair/11</link>
    <description>I&#39;m Andrey. I started [**Antair**][1] back in 2005. Before that, I was a developer for various financial firms on Wall Street.

In the context of this forum, some of you may know me as the co-host of the **[Bootstrapped.fm][2]** podcast, along with @ianlandsman.

Antair, up to this point, has mostly been about mobile apps. We built apps, primarily for BlackBerry, before there was such a thing as an app store, or really a mobile market in general. 

Over the years, we&#39;ve released dozens of products -- most are mobile applications, a few are not -- most were our own products, a few were for various clients.

Our latest product is called [**Uberdeck**][3], a SaaS app that allows mobile developers to send marketing campaigns directly to their mobile apps.

You can follow my weekly adventures on the **[Bootstrapped.fm][4]** podcast, but if you have specific questions, feel free to post them here.
