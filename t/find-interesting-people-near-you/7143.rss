    <description>Kardius lets you find interesting people near you. This done by having you swipe on polarizing topics (e.g. Hunting, Anime, Parties) and then using your votes to calculate your similarity percentages with other users. You swipe to the right if you support the concept and to the left otherwise. You can also list your interests and then filter posts and users by criteria like distance, similarity, activity, interests, age, etc. You can then message others or chat in real time in public posts.</description>
