            <p>I think I missed the tour page because the Tour link is no more prominent than any of the other nav links. I personally tend to miss obvious things, though, so I don’t know if other people would have the same problem.</p>

            <p>Thanks a lot Jason!</p>
<ol>
<li>we do plan to charge, the service will only be free while in beta. We want to reward early adopters who don’t mind the occasional bugs.</li>
<li>good point, we’ll consider this. Did you miss the tour page because you couldn’t visually identify it easily?</li>
</ol>

            <p>Very visually impressive. I haven’t seen a better-looking site in a while. I also think you did a fantastic job with the “Sign Up” CTA. I couldn’t help but click on it, even before I read anything about what the product was.</p>
<p>A couple thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just as an anecdote of my personal experience, I offered my product, Snip, for free in the very beginning when I was trying to get my first users. I found it extraordinarily difficult to “sell” the product for free, but then when I started charging, it was like a magic switch got flipped and I started getting customers. My guess is that a) I seemed more credible with a product that actually cost money and b) people valued the offering more when it had a price attached to it. Charging also helped with onboarding as there was a clear delineation between “in” and “out.” When Snip was free, I would have people <em>kind of</em> start using it, and it was hard to tell if they were really serious or not. It’s not hard to tell whether or not I have someone’s credit card number on file or not. Again, that was my personal experience and not necessarily representative of a typical charging/not charging experience.</li>
<li>It took me a little bit to understand what your offering was. Maybe that’s because I’m not a designer. I immediately gravitated toward the Pricing &amp; Signup page but it took me a long time to notice that there was a Tour page as well. Maybe a secondary CTA to take a tour would be helpful.</li>
</ol>
