    <title>Find a technical cofounder</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/find-a-technical-cofounder/5206</link>
    <description>Hello guys,

I am an intermediate developer and I can code decently in php. However, for my latest project I am looking for a technical cofounder who is good with nodejs and javascript, as the application uses a lot of real-time APIs. 

I was thinking to hire someone on from upwork or freelancers to code these parts for me, but I think besides my product related value proposition, developing and deploying new features - faster than the competition - will become extremely important when the journey progresses.

Where have you found your technical cofounder?(who is as obsessed as you to create a startup :wink: )

Thx in advance for your replies!</description>

</aside>
<p>Unfortunately, I am not able to tell you where or how to find a technical co-founder, but I do think you should not limit your search to developers with experience in Node.js and/or JavaScript, as experience with these specific technologies are probably not the most important criteria for a good co-founder.</p>
<p>Experience with JavaScript for the client-side of things is probably a good idea in your case (assuming you are talking about a browser-based application), but I would not make the assumption that Node.js is the required (or even best) solution on the back-end side of things.</p>
<p>I wrote more on the subject of what to look for in a technical co-founder in <a href="http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/finding-a-tech-co-founder/5230/2?u=asandvig">my response to a similar thread</a>.</p>

            <p>Hey Gregor,</p>
<p>Don’t know where to find a technical cofounder – but as it happens I <em>am</em> one.  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  I’ve been building out Reviewable (JS + Node + Firebase) and I’m still pretty busy with it, but I’m always willing to be tempted with a new venture.  Ping me at piotr at ideanest dot com if you’d like to chat.</p>
