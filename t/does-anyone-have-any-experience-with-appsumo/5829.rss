    <title>Does anyone have any experience with AppSumo?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/does-anyone-have-any-experience-with-appsumo/5829</link>
    <description>I hear a lot about AppSumo and how it can do a lot to get a product name out there. Much of the positive media stories seem to come from a few years ago so I’m not sure if it’s still as powerful as it was.

Has anyone had a product featured on AppSumo? Or had one turned down? Any insights either way?

I noticed that their submission page seems to have vanished into a 404, as has most of their pages indexed by google.</description>

            <p>It’s exposure I was looking for rather than a cash influx. Finally found a support email for them – on a cached Google page from a few weeks ago. It seems they’ve had a site redesign and all the old contact pages are gone, replaced by nothing. I’ll see what happens.</p>

            <p>People I know who have used AppSumo said it was mostly useful to get a nice surge of cash.</p>
<p>If your business is cash-strapped, and could do with some money up front to invest in further dev and marketing, consider it.</p>
<p>If you have a comfortable amount of cash in your business, AppSumo is probably not worthwhile.</p>

            <p>I’ve heard that most do it because of the instant push in publicity and users. Not for the profit, as AppSumo is taking a big cut and the lifetime deals are not really helping your long term monetization.</p>
<p>But it may be interesting if you want to have a few hundred new users within a week to gain their insights, questions and feedback and if you see the cut for AppSumo as ad spending or research money…</p>

            <p>Thanks for that. Some great detail there. I’ll chase up the guy who posted and see if he can help out with a submission email or contact.</p>
