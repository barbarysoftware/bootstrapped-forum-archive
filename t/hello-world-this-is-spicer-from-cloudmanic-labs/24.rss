    <title>Hello World. This is Spicer From Cloudmanic Labs</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hello-world-this-is-spicer-from-cloudmanic-labs/24</link>
    <description>Howdy. 

I am the Founder and CEO at [Cloudmanic Labs][1]. We are Portland Oregon based. That does not say much because our entire team is remote. We have been in business for 15 years. Like many we started out as a consulting agency and over time morphed into a product company. Today we build web and mobile apps with a strong focus around building software for the small business.
