    <title>Remarkbox is the Disqus Alternative</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/remarkbox-is-the-disqus-alternative/4871</link>
    <description>Hello, 

My name is Russell Ballestrini and I&#39;ve been lurking in this forum for a while and receiving email updates.

I bootstrapped my first SaaS offering 5 years ago. Since then I have attempted to reproduce my original success but none of my ideas have captured any traction.

My latest project, Remarkbox ([remarkbox.com](http://remarkbox.com)) is a hosted comments as a service offering.  My hypothesis is that bloggers and static site owners would be willing to pay a monthly fee for an easier to use, alternative to Disqus.

Although I&#39;m familiar with lean startups and bootstrapping, I decided to build a fully functional prototype. I basically scratched an itch that I was having when I moved my personal blog from Wordpress to Pelican a static-site-generator.  I&#39;m using Remarkbox on all my static sites now so I&#39;m dog-fooding my product.

I&#39;ve decided to slow down on development of Remarkbox to work on marketing.  I&#39;ve basically come up with a number of people I would like to have in my Beta list before working on any more functionality.  If I can&#39;t get enough people I&#39;m going to stop and switch to another idea.  I&#39;ll definitely keep Remarkbox online and continue to offer the Free version, I&#39;m relying on it after all, but no new development.

My long term goal is to eventually leave my day job and work on my own companies so if I&#39;m going to do that, I&#39;m going to need to become profitable.  This means I need to find problems people are willing to pay to have solved. I&#39;m still on the fence if Remarkbox solves a painful enough problem.

Please let me know what you think about Remarkbox, any suggestions or perspectives will really help.  Launching things as a solo founder is an isolating experience but seeing email updates from this forum helps!

Thank you

<p>Yes.  For example, I had a silly hackathon project where instead of the threads being URIs they were latitude/longitude coordinates of the browser.  It was like having a forum anywhere you went.  I dropped precision so it was like 1 kilometer threads.</p>

<p>Or is it looking at the parameter names or host name (usually internal IP in my case) where the app is hosted to determine the “namespace”?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In “embed mode” Remarkbox uses the domain part of the URI as the <code>Namespace</code> and the <code>thread</code> is the whole URI.</p>
<p>For example: if the parent page’s URL is <code>https://www.example.com/page-1.html</code></p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Namespace</code> would be <code>www.example.com</code>
</li>
<li>The <code>thread</code> would be <code>https://www.example.com/page-1.html</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That said the thread could be a different identifier, it doesn’t necessarily need to be the URI.</p>
<p>To make it work for an internal site, you would likely want to give the internal on-premise application a sub domain for various reasons (private ip addresses are often reserved and any network could use it).</p>
<p>All that said, the communications wouldn’t be private so if these are internal communications Remarkbox isn’t a great choice.  For Remarkbox to be private it would also have to run on prem.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/russell_ballestrini">@Russell_Ballestrini</a>, probably a weird question, but I’m considering some functionality. My on-premise application has a web-interface, so the whole team can use it from the same internal server. There are a few places where I think they should  actually be leaving notes and comments to each other.</p>
<p>I assume if I add Remarkbox to the app pages, by default I’d probably made team in different companies talk to each other, right? Because the page names would be the same. Not what I want. Or is it looking at the parameter names or host name (usually internal IP in my case) where the app is hosted to determine the “namespace”?</p>

            <p>Hmmm, that is odd.  Are you sure you are logged in? Your comment should be verified when you log in (assuming you are using the same browser) but if this doesn’t work (sometimes it doesn’t) you should be able to click a <code>verify</code> button below the comment.</p>
<p>Also, if you are logged in, If you click your username you should be able to click account settings and change your username, as well as enable gravatar.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can take a peak at the back end dashboard here: <a href="https://my.remarkbox.com" rel="nofollow noopener">https://my.remarkbox.com</a> - this is the area I’m currently focusing on to setup self service so that I can get out of Beta. If you don’t want to wait for self service I can manually hook up your domain if you want a fast track to using it on your site.</p>

            <p>Glad to hear an update about this. I’m still eager to give this a shot and test its speed vs disqus. But there are two hold ups from my end</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your site is still offering ‘beta’ signups. I don’t want beta - I want to use your product. Perhaps it’s still in beta in regards to stuff like <span class="hashtag">#2</span> below, but it’s been 3 years - get out of beta already <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tried your latest demo, got the email to verify, clicked on it and nothing happened. My comment was still unverified, and I didn’t see where I could “change your username as well as edit or delete past comments.”</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <p><strong>Hello everyone.  Here is an update on my progress:</strong></p>
<p>I’ve implemented a concept of Namespaces to allow certain users the ability to moderate or own certain parts of Remarkbox.  I’ve created a concept of Namepspace owners and Namespace moderators, owners can change Namespace settings like custom CSS etc, while moderators are only allowed to edit or delete comments.</p>
<p>If you sign up for Remarkbox, the domain of your site is your Namespace.</p>
<p>I’m using the “stand alone mode” of Remarkbox (and this new concept of Namespaces) to power both the FAQ and the Meta sites for Remarkbox (<a href="https://faq.remarkbox.com" rel="nofollow noopener">https://faq.remarkbox.com</a> and <a href="https://meta.remarkbox.com" rel="nofollow noopener">https://meta.remarkbox.com</a>)</p>
<p><strong>As for sales:</strong></p>
<p>I’ve closed my 3rd paying customer!</p>
<p><strong>As for marketing:</strong></p>
<p>I setup this landing page to try to target unhappy Disqus users:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.remarkbox.com/finally-a-disqus-alternative.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.remarkbox.com/finally-a-disqus-alternative.html</a></p>
<p>Over all things are going slow but I’m more excited then ever.</p>
<p>My next goal for this month is to complete the SaaS self sign up flow.  If I can get this working I can put more of my effort into marketing.</p>
<p>My question for today: What do you guys thing about selling “FAQ pages as a service”?  I feel like this could be more lucrative (business to business instead of business to blogger).  This wouldn’t be a hard pivot, but would be another offering.</p>

<p>He can give the app to open source/community sites for free. It will be running on their servers, not increasing his bills but increasing his recognition (and some support costs, alas, but oh well, this is unavoidable).</p>
<p>He can partner with hosting cos to install the app as an option for static hosting sites.</p>
<p>He can make an image on DigitalOcean and sell them at $10/mo (the image cost is $5, the rest is profit) as a ready to spin commenting system for events or such.</p>
<p>That is just from the top of my head.</p>
<p>And while you found a lot for “hosted comments system”, I’ve found only one (on the first page) for “<strong>self</strong>-hosted comments system”.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that this is the way to go, but just that there are angles to attack the problem.</p>
<p>(P.S. Found another one: de:comments - $50/site. If they make money, there should be a market outside of Disqus.)</p>

            <p>Thank you for your naysaying.  I came up with this same list of objections (3 years ago) and still decided it was worth a try.  If for nothing else, I still have a better comment system for my own projects.  If I can provide an arguable better service to a few people on the side with minimal spend on marketing, its worth it, for my personal brand alone.</p>
<p>Yes, Free and $5/mo plan customers can sometimes act entitled and often complain the most (often publicly) but I’m not ready to toss out the baby with the bath water. If anything, I actually think it would be fun to operate and scale this service if the free plan explodes.  I wrote it to scale. Even if I break even at the end of the month, I would still do it.</p>
<p>Personally, I strongly feel there is a niche market of people who are sick of Facebook and Disqus and will pay to have a better option. If that doesn’t work, I still have a couple pivots up my sleeve.</p>
<p>At this point most of the product is finished and working. I would be crazy to <em>not</em> have a landing page and try to sell it.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m gonna be a naysayer: this category is way too mature to compete with a slightly tweaked product.</p>
<p>It’s not just Disqus (which is 10 years old now and apparently on 750k sites) but also Intense Debate from Automattic (makers of WordPress) and LiveFyre and muut and Facebook Comments. This is what I found searching for “hosted comments system”.</p>
<p>How are you planning to become one of the options there? How are you going to beat accumulated 10 years of SEO of your competitors?</p>
<p>Comments system have powerful network effects. Users would rather use existing Disqus login to comment than signup for another service and website owners take that into account when picking a comment system.</p>
<p>Also, while the desire to not annoy your users (be it site owners or comments) is noble, it’s worth pondering why Disqus does the annoying thing they do?</p>
<p>My educated guess is that on average it works for their business and brings more users than not annoying them. What they do might be sleazy but it’s probably effective and in business you don’t always have option to take the high road.</p>
<p>Notice that the annoyed Disqus users still use Disqus, they didn’t bother to switch to muut, LiveFyre etc., which all have free options. Their revealed preference (what they do vs. what they say) suggests that Disqus is pretty sticky for them and they are unlikely to switch because the amount of work would be more than hypothetical benefits.</p>
<p>Even without competition this would be a tough business. People (as opposed to companies) are not that eager to pay  even paltry $5/month for completely non-essential service. We might all marvel at the irrationality of not willing to part with equivalent of 2 cups of coffee but that’s the reality.</p>
<p>That’s why those kinds of businesses pretty much require massive user base using the product for free to get %0.1 to pay to sustain the business. And for $5/month you get the worst kind of customers (cheap and entitled).</p>
<p>This is not a good kind of business for bootstrapped/solo/indie person if only because at some point you’ll spend all your time dealing with operational issues of launching more servers, debugging issues and trying to provide support when things inevitably go wrong for the (mostly free) users.</p>
<p>Disqus is massive today, they seem like a stable company employing tens of people but it took them $10 million in funding to get there and they don’t have a amazing business (or they would IPO by now).</p>
<p>Generalizing a better solo business is one where you can charge $20+ so that you can become sustainable with much smaller customer base and therefore you can attack an underserved niche, rather that competing with companies that already have hundreds of thousands of users and massive SEO advantage.</p>

<p>yes, I think the invalid email is causing the exception.  I have added this error to my backlog and will hopefully fix it tonight.</p>

            <p>Hey Russell - I love this idea. I have wanted to use Disqus on some sites of mine, but I hate their load time and their ads, so I simply won’t.</p>
<p>I went to the bottom of your landing page and tried the “Remarkbox Demo - try it out!” area. It failed - got a “502 Bad Gateway - nginx” error. I put in fake data so perhaps that killed it? Maybe validate inputs better? Reproduce by entering “gdfgdfgdfgdfg” for both message and email.</p>

<p>This is off-topic, but your introduction caught my attention when you referred to a previous SaaS success. Is there a place (comment thread, blog post, etc.) where I can find out more about the story of LinkPeek? Thanks!</p>

            <p>Mmm… you have a stand-along version? Don’t abandon it, some larger consumers may want to have it on premise under their full control. And make it your competitive advantage - Disqus doesn’t have it, does it?</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>$14/mo Moderator access for <strong>unlimited</strong> verified domains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t do that. Don’t do that. You’ll regret.</p>
<p>Large consumers will probably need enterprisey features - company accounts with admin that can grant rights, integration to their systems, stats, SLA(!), 24/7 support, API. You won’t cover it for extra $9/mo. It worth hundreds.</p>
<p>Just say that enterprise version is in plans (contacts us with requirements).</p>
<p>The second tier can be a multi-site layer, for people like me who runs a few small-traffic sites (i.e. one admin only, no 2nd admin or a team).</p>
<p>Agencies who manage multiple disjoint sites could be third tier - multiple admins, but each admin can admin each site in a group.</p>
<p>And general I’d suggest to create tiers based on projected usage. However, do not charge by usage – that would be micro-calculations (“each post costs $0.0012”) and is very confusing.</p>
