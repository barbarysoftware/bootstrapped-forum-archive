    <title>Has anyone used Twitter to find ideas for products online?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/has-anyone-used-twitter-to-find-ideas-for-products-online/3388</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not a Twitter user, but out of curiosity, I searched for some topics that I am interested in. It was interesting to see many people asking questions and asking for help on a variety of topics. I am not sure how they can be helped in 140 characters but it was interesting to watch.

Has anyone found an idea for an app/product on Twitter? What is the methodology you used?</description>

            <p>I have a notebook with interesting ideas collected from twitter. I look at it time to time to see if I can create a new product. So far, I didn’t get any ideas that pushed me to develop one (though I got the idea for current product from a FB post). I use two methods:</p>
<p>Follow this handle: <a href="https://twitter.com/IsThereASite" rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/IsThereASite</a><br>
People ask ‘Is there a tool…’: <a href="https://t.co/8RjlhDQQuJ" rel="nofollow noopener">https://t.co/8RjlhDQQuJ</a> . Note those questions and see if you can develop one.</p>
