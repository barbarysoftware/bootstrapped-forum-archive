    <title>Who covers reseller expenses</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/who-covers-reseller-expenses/3573</link>
    <description>If I have SaaS resellers that are paid a percentage of the monthly subscription and the reseller was doing sales and maketing who would cover those expenses (advertising, creating brochures etc). I assume the reseller would cover anything outside of our standard collateral otherwise the percentage we pay them would be just straight profit.</description>

            <p>It would be weird to pay a reseller’s expenses. What would be the point of the reseller? Just run the ads yourself and keep 100% of the sale. If they are paying for stuff, that’s good - it means they have some skin in the game.</p>
