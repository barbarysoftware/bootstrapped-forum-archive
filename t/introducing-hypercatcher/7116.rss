    <description>Hi, my name is David and I’m working on a podcast app called HyperCatcher. HyperCatcher is a podcast app that makes your favorite podcasts even better! HyperCatcher uses machine learning algorithms to identify bookmarks in podcasts so you can jump to what your interested in, jump over parts you’re not and save a list of detailed topics discussed during the podcast. Hypercatcher also pulls interesting information out of podcast show notes and surfaces browsable Twitter and Instagram profiles directly on the app.HyperCatcher is the best podcast app for your favorite show.

Looking forward to sharing progress with the community and getting any feedback you might have for me. Thank you!</description>
