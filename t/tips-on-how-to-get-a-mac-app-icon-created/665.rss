    <title>Tips on how to get a Mac app icon created?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/tips-on-how-to-get-a-mac-app-icon-created/665</link>
    <description>The designer I normally use has hit the road and is currently unavailable.

I&#39;m looking for someone to make an application icon for a Mac desktop app. I&#39;m looking for someone with experience doing this, so that they are already up to speed with Apple&#39;s design guidelines for app icons. I&#39;ve tried oDesk in the past and been unhappy with the result I got.

Got any tips on where to look or who to ask?

            <p>I’d also suggest you look around <a href="http://dribbble.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Dribbble</a> next time. Designers can set their profile whether they’re available for work or not, and you can get a sense of their work quality immediately from their uploaded images.</p>

            <p>Thanks!</p>
<p>So in the end I tried <a href="https://www.odesk.com/">oDesk</a> again. This time things seem to be going well so far. I’ve stumbled upon someone who is impressing me with his skills, communication, and process.</p>
<p>Being cynical I can already predict the outcome here: as he gets “discovered” he’ll become less and less available and responsive as he gets overwhelmed with repeat clients. sigh.</p>

            <p>As vivek mentioned, it depends on your price range. I had good luck with fiverr. I’ve used it to find someone that I liked and I paid them outside fiverr.</p>

            <p>Depends on your price range. I know of the high-end mac-specific design firms like pacific helm <a href="http://pacifichelm.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://pacifichelm.com/</a> and iconfactory <a href="http://design.iconfactory.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://design.iconfactory.com/</a> .  You may want to ping other ios/mac bootstrappers on twitter to see who they used.</p>
