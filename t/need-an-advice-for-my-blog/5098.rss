    <title>Need an advice for my blog</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/need-an-advice-for-my-blog/5098</link>
    <description>Hello,
I have recently created my blog dmarketer.com (Search for **dmarketer** on google I can&#39;t post links) I haven&#39;t spent a penny to get this blog up and running except Hosting &amp; Genesis Framework.

I had customized theme myself and written some high-quality articles.

I need advice on:
Blog Design,
Content Improvement,
Anything you want to share.

Thanks</description>
