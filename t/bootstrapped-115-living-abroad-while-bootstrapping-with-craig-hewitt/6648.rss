    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/bootstrapped-115-living-abroad-while-bootstrapping-with-craig-hewitt/6648</link>
    <description>@CraigHewitt and I are both bootstrapping our businesses while living in foreign countries. In this episode we discuss what that’s like for us personally. We discuss the challenging practicalities of visas, languages, and business while living abroad.

            <p>Was a lot of fun Steve! I hope everyone found it helpful if they are (or are thinking about) moving abroad, especially in this crazy life of ours with bootstrapping a business, and even moreso with kids. Lots to think about.</p>
