    <description>Hey Discusss Bootstrapped! I&#39;m Rich, the founder of a website called [Failory](https://www.failory.com/) where I weekly publish startup-related content.

I started the site one year and a half ago and in December of 2017, I turned the site into an open startup. This means that I am openly sharing the metrics and analytics of the website. One of the things I do is to write monthly reports detailing what I worked in and the results.

After 11 days of being busy, I have finally had some time to write February&#39;s monthly report and, as I am really happy with this month&#39;s stats and how the article came out, I thought it was a cool idea to share it ;)

I know you are busy people so I&#39;ve also written a summary of this +3,000-words article, which you can find [here](https://twitter.com/clominson/status/1105193190972362754). But if you have some time, I recommend you to check out the entire article below!!

https://www.failory.com/open/february-2019

Would love to learn what you think about my monetization strategy. I was thinking about trying some ADs networks such as Mediavine. Should I try it or keep using sponsorships?</description>
