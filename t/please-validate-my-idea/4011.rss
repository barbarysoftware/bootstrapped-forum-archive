    <description>My main SaaS business deals with patient information, and I not only made sure it was HIPAA compliant, but also implemented some additional security features. 

I&#39;m in the process of extracting 2 of these features into a simple API so I can build a product around them. Both are ways to enhance user authentication for SaaS apps:

1) **2-factor authentication as a service**: this one would handle the 2nd authentication step, either using time-based tokens or SMS. I know it&#39;s nothing new, there are a couple of services doing this. I would just try to position it a little bit differently and make it dead simple to implement. 

2) **Suspicious login detection**: this is a simple API call. After you authenticate your user, give me their user id and IP address and I&#39;ll let you know if that login is suspicious based on their login history, geo location and other heuristics. You can choose what to do next. Based on your settings, I can even handle emailing the user with an unlock token or warn them of the unusual activity in their account.

These 2 features could save a few days of development and ongoing maintenance. Would you pay to add this extra layer of security to your SaaS? If so, how much?

Thanks in advance!</description>

<li>How many customers have you spoken to?</li>
<li>How many said “Yes” when you asked them to buy it?<br>
(after they say yes, you can say “it’s not ready yet, but you’ll be the first to know” OR you could use <a href="http://Tilt.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Tilt.com</a> and “charge” them (with hefty discount) but the charge doesn’t go thru until the beta is released.</li>

            <p>Greetings</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If your customers are running B2C businesses, wouldn’t it make sense for them to integrate with Google/Facebook/Microsoft auth services</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your customers are running B2B businesses, they would likely want to integrate with federal ID services like OneLogin. It could make senses to add 2 factor auth as an authentication provider to federal login providers, though as to whether there is a gap there, more research would be required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you offering two-factor auth via SMS, then there could be a nice revenue model there. Say you could just add a margin on top of SMS wholesale minutes. The user buy packages consisting of a certain number of auth requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my opinion, your idea needs to be expanded. A bigger vision needs to be outlined. There is not enough meat in your service.</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <p>Having had the pleasure of creating systems like these from scratch for a HIPAA-compliant, HITRUST-certified project, I know for a fact I would’ve used services like the two you proposed. We searched high and low for dead simple API-based services, and, at the time (back in 2007) they just did not exist.</p>
<p>Sorry to say—since we’ve already built all of that infrastructure from scratch—I’m not a potential customer.</p>
<p>But, I can heartily disagree with Erica’s prior reply, and validate that I would’ve been a customer of API-based microservices like this.</p>
<p>Yeah, like Erica wrote above, I’m a developer and I can tell you fifteen or so different approaches to doing these kinds of things on my own. But, thinking like a CTO and a business owner instead of a coder for a minute, you realize there is much to gain from avoiding the Not Built Here Syndrome and integrating a few pre-built building blocks where it makes sense. Don’t reinvent wheels, spend your time and brain glucose on something more worth your time.</p>

<p>I do not work in this industry, but I were to run a business that operates on sensitive data like this, I think I would spend the extra few days or even weeks and get this right myself.

</aside>
<p>Thanks for the feedback! I wouldn’t be targeting HIPAA compliant businesses. I think these security measures are becoming expected because the big providers offer them. For example, when you try to access gmail from a different country/state/city, it will either force you to authenticate your phone number, or send you a warning email.</p>
<p>I think every B2B should be able to offer great security, even when not dealing with patient records or credit cards.</p>

<p>If I’m not mistaken, the 2FA part and the data storage part is separate - I can even use Google’s 2FA service and it’s pretty easy to set up.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I didn’t know Google offered 2FA for non-google accounts; I’ll have to look into that. Either way there seems to be a market for it, because <a href="http://authy.com" rel="nofollow noopener">authy.com</a> (owned by Twilio) does it.</p>
<p>I think the unique feature would be the suspicious login detection, because, AFAIK, no one offers it, and it’s harder to build than 2FA. You need access to an up-to-date geo location database and a relatively smart algorithm to detect it, avoid false positives, etc.</p>
<p>If my SaaS wasn’t dealing with patient records, I would never have bothered building it, but I would still have liked to have it as an extra security layer if it took me 20 min to setup and a few bucks per month.</p>
