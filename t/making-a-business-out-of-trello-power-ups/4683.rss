    <title>Making a business out of Trello Power Ups</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/making-a-business-out-of-trello-power-ups/4683</link>
    <description>Hi all 

Good day to everyone. 

I have a question about building tools for platforms.
For example, bots for Slack, CRM for G-suite, integration tools for Salesforce

I&#39;m wondering if anyone successfully manage to make a business out from a Power Up on Trello.
Recently, I made a report generator (as a power up on Trell) for myself. I&#39;m thinking of making it a tiny sass product and wondering if anyone had success in making a business out from paltform tools.

Thank you.</description>

            <p>If you check the Trello blog you can find many power ups that appear to be running as standalone products. No idea as to how successful they are but there is a large enough audience that it’s probably possible with the right offering.</p>
