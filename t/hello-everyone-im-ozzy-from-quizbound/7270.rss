    <description>Hello everyone, 

We are a Saas startup from U.S and we have just launced our product. We are looking for some feedback. It would be nice if you check it out and contact with us. Sadly, I can&#39;t share any links with you because I am a new user but you can search quizbound on Google if you want to check our product. I&#39;ll update this page and share the links with you as soon as I can. Thank you for your time and help.</description>

            <p>All the links in your websites footer seem to be broken.</p>
<p>Is quiz the right word? The one on your site is more like an interactive sales funnel. I expect a quiz to have some kind of score and a fun factor. That, or you’re not dogfooding your own product… ?</p>
