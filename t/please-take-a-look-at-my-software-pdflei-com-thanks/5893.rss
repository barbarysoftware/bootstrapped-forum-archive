    <description>Hi, I am Mark. Here is my product which took me a long time to finish.  Please google pdfLei (sorry, new user no link)
It&#39;s a pdf file manage and viewer. It offers its user a tool to manage and view hundreds or thousands of pdf files.
The main selling point is that it&#39;s packed features and It provides a seamless experience for the end-users.

I am new to create and market software, so any input will be highly appreciated.</description>

<p>The thing is, who uses your software is not up to you. I’m, in a way, in the same space (I wrote <a href="https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/</a>). I see pdf viewer/manager as mostly used by individuals.</p>
<p>If you want to sell an enterprise version, you would have to figure out features that individuals don’t care but companies do.</p>
<p>Even then this is not the kind of software you can sell the way Oracle sells their database. Even if a company buys it, it’s still a small utility and is bought at small utility prices via one-time purchase, like all other small utilities.</p>
<p>Re: website. It’s an over-all impression.</p>
<p>I collect links to what I consider pretty websites: <a href="https://www.notion.so/nicedesign-nice-design-nice-ui-good-ui-good-design-41ac946c558c477ea3adf8a36d7617bb#0bd4f08bac4b4c8faf767732e9e655a0" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.notion.so/nicedesign-nice-design-nice-ui-good-ui-good-design-41ac946c558c477ea3adf8a36d7617bb#0bd4f08bac4b4c8faf767732e9e655a0</a></p>
<p>When I write a landing page for an application, those are the pages I use as an inspiration.</p>
<p>Some common things among the “pretty” pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>the important links are at the top</li>
<li>light colors (vs. rather grab gray)</li>
<li>leading with screenshots (vs. mostly blank space)</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally I’m not a good web designer so the way I approach web design is: find the best looking page created by a good designer and imitate it.</p>

            <p>Thanks. I was thinking about selling it as enterprise software, but that could be changed. Could you be more specific about making the website prettier? I don’t know how important the screenshots might be, will add them. really appreicate!</p>

            <p>You’re selling end-user software as if it was enterprise software.</p>
<p>Requiring an e-mail address to download the software will drastically cut your downloads.</p>
<p>Make it a free download with 30-day trial.</p>
<p>I doubt people will pay a subscription for desktop software. Make it one-time pay, at least initially. Sell it for $29.</p>
<p>Licensing fee based on number of cores? You’re not Larry Ellison. People don’t know how many “cores” their laptops have and if they do, they call them “processors”.</p>
<p>Start with free/paid. At some point you might figure out a way to upsell based on features but at the beginning keep things simple.</p>
<p>Add screenshots.</p>
<p>Make the website prettier.</p>
