    <title>Anyone here using PayMate?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/anyone-here-using-paymate/7567</link>
    <description>Regarding the issue of FastSpring going downhill (see other threads here), I&#39;m Australian and just noticed PayMate today:

https://global.paymate.com/pricing-online-moto-australian-fees/

It appears they only take a flat 2.60% from each sale (for Aussies), with same or next day payment direct to my bank account. This is way better than PayPal (which I use), so I was wondering if anyone has any experience with them? It also means I can escape any PayPal disputes (which fraudulent customers love to do!) and also not pay any PayPal fees to get my money.

They also handle international payments, too (with an extra 2.75% conversion fee).</description>
