    <title>Hello, I&#39;m Aditya from Resumonk</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hello-im-aditya-from-resumonk/1695</link>
    <description>Hello,
I&#39;m [Aditya Babbar][1], Co-Founder of [Resumonk][2]. It helps in creating a beautiful &amp; impressive resume quickly. Number of paying customers is increasing steadily every month and hopefully it would be a fully sustainable business for us soon!  

Before Resumonk, I also created a SaaS product targeted towards Indian schools as a solo founder. It also has paying customers, and that venture taught me some invaluable lessons.

I also do consulting work on the side and we are based in Delhi, India.

I&#39;d look forward to exchanging notes with all of you and sharing our bootstrapping experience.
