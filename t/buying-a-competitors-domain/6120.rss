    <title>Buying a competitors domain</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/buying-a-competitors-domain/6120</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve a competitor who&#39;s exited this particular niche and I&#39;ve got an option to buy their domain.

For lots of reasons I won&#39;t be purchasing their business or dealing with any existing customers - this is purely about their existing website/domain and any &#39;google juice&#39; that can be extracted from it.

* How would you do this technology for maximum SEO value - guessing a 301 redirect back to my site?
* How would you go about trying to value this - tools for counting inbound links/estimates of traffic?
* Any things to watch out for - things like a risk of negative reputation either SEO wise or from existing customers who feel they have been abandoned etc?</description>

<p>Ideally, you would 301 redirect to a similar path with similar content on your own domain. Otherwise the ‘juice’ will be spilt once google realizes the content is no longer a match.</p>

</aside>
<p>Defo this, it’s not just google search result links from their old site it’s all those backlinks that their domain has.</p>
<p>in an ideal world you’d map as many of their urls to similar or related content on your site.</p>

            <p>Interesting - it’s not really feasible or desirable to reproduce similar content as all their content is about their own product which no longer exists.</p>
<p>So if the ‘juice’ is spilt then the value to me would be minimal I guess - only their existing customers asking ‘what happened to XXX’ which I could capture if I can get a page/post on my site mentioning their name/domain indexed.</p>

<p>We have been using ahrefs to watch/recommend seo, but there are so many tools available.</p>
<p>The value of the domain is a little  your opinion and a little what do you think it would be worth without the juice. After a couple of months of redirecting the value will be in the domain only unless there are many links existing from 3rd parties. I have been quoted recently $25k for two word domains (not saying they would get that, but two different services for two completely unrelated domains).</p>
