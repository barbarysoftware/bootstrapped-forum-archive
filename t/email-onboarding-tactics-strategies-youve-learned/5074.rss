    <title>Email Onboarding : Tactics &amp; Strategies you&#39;ve learned?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/email-onboarding-tactics-strategies-youve-learned/5074</link>
    <description>I&#39;m improving the Email onboarding for my SaaS app (for speech therapy treatment software).


Some things I&#39;ve learned:

* Send **MORE emails**.   I was sending only a couple of introductory emails, worried about overloading folks. 
* **Shorter emails**. Put only one small Task in each email. As a consequence of not wanting to send too MANY emails, I crammed a lot into each one,like links to 6 intro videos (one for each &quot;part&quot; of the program).  My rule of thumb (which I ignored!) has always been: the chance of someone reading a sentence is  c=1/Word-Count.  Chance of reading an email is about 100/Word-Count.

My next plan is a sequence of &quot;next step emails&quot;. The very smallest steps a user can take. We can detect these using the Stats we store in Mixpanel, which lets us send Notification emails (or SMS, which we don&#39;t use)

**What have YOU learned, or what problems do you have?**

            <p>Something that’s worked well for me has been segmented new users based on their behavior and changing which user gets what.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you take the path to quickest value? If so, we’ll give you more advanced educational content to help you succeed.</li>
<li>Stumble getting started? then we’ll send you emails that are more basic how-tos about the app, and end every email with “hit reply to talk to a support representative.”</li>
</ul>

            <p>I have also learned to only ask 30 seconds worth of questions in a support email.</p>
<p>As an engineer who READS I prefer to get it all done ASAP, with IF A, B, C then do D, Else do F.</p>
<p>But it’s MUCH better to <strong>just ask one question at a time</strong> (especially with presales, where I start with a <em>qualifying</em> question before I go down a rabbit hole.</p>
<p>Also, as someone described once:  sales is like dating. You don’t’ go in for a hug and a kiss when you see someone for the first time. Baby Steps.</p>

<li>Shorter is more likely to be read and acted upon.</li>
<li>Bullet points are great.<br>

            <p>+1 for the short emails - it’s something I also see with support emails. Even to a supposedly bright technical audience the attention span drops surprisingly quickly… <em>Ohh look a cat riding a unicycle backwards ===&gt;</em></p>
<p>Also bullet points work really well I find - both for helping keep you brief and marking individual questions or points to the user. Just use * and blank lines if you don’t have a RTE.</p>

            <p>Don’t have the numbers to hand and my niche is not your niche etc. but :-</p>
<ul>
<li>I ran an A/B test a few years ago with an onboarding email containing pretty much the same information : plain text email v one with a screenshot v one with a ‘full design’ (like the typical sort of email newsletter you might get from a big name, columns / borders, logos etc). The simple one with screenshot did best, closely followed by the plain one and a LONG way back was the full design one.</li>
</ul>
