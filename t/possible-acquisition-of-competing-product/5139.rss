    <title>Possible Acquisition of competing Product</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/possible-acquisition-of-competing-product/5139</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently searching for advise on a possible acquisition of a competing product. The situation is:

The only competing product with a similar USP has mostly stopped development 6 months ago as the founders have moved on to a different company (there is no team in place for the existing product) so I reached out to see if they are up to a possible aquisition / partnership. They came back to me with a yes and lots of details about the business. 

- They still have revenue mostly from maintainance renewals (this is a desktop software not a SAAS).
- They have around 25000 leads and 1300 customers
- 2-3 features would be a great addition to my existing product

So the aquisition would be less about the technologie and mostly about aquirering customers / leads. They sell mainly through word of mouth but the SEO benefits would still be there.

My question is, how do I make up my mind about wether this is a smart move? How would I try to minimize the one time payment and instead offer some kind of deal with maybe revenue sharing for a time (or something totally different). 

Anybody experiences / opinions?</description>

            <p>I’ve seen Jay Abraham talk about this all the time. There are about 4-5 ways to go here including just offering a revenue share of all future customers.</p>
<p>What’s their churn rate eg at what stage with the business we worth almost nothing for them?</p>
<p>Can you think of an offer that pays nothing upfront but has a backend upside for them and you to minimise your risk of overpaying?</p>
<p>How bad do you want it and how badly do they want to get rid of it?<br>
Answer these 2 questions and you might have the sweet spot.</p>

<p>No they don’t really have a strong brand at all. The only valuable thing here would be the possible SEO benefit.</p>

            <p>What you want, is their clients and their LTV.<br>
As you do not care for the software at all ( and those features I guess you will have to re-code them ), ask them to buy the customers.</p>
<p>How?<br>
You go ahead and pay them, the LTV of the client for a year, if the user re-new or want to move over to your platform. The ways you can do that are many, but into my eyes, it is a certain way to manage know, how many of those total 2.500 leads and 1.300 customers will keep paying for you. Because if you pay more than should and never re-coup, no effort.</p>
<p>Also, do you want to buy the brand?<br>
What is their domain value, backlinks, any content etc?</p>
