    <title>Pros and cons of this project</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/pros-and-cons-of-this-project/3666</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I have this idea stuck in my mind, maybe because it&#39;s an almost done(80%) project using modules from past projects.

Even though SaaS is not the target market, usually you guys come with some great insights.

I&#39;ll post the url of the landing page without the description because I want to know if you can figure out what it does.  bit.ly/1PKWmG9

There are a few use cases on the page.

What are your first thoughts?</description>

            <p>I agree with the above comments: will be used very infrequently.</p>
<p>A better application of this technology is for A/B split testing.</p>
<p>Or, basically, any time a non technical person wants to edit a website.<br>
But I suspect that people need that a lot less if they are using a CMS like wordpress.</p>

            <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Yea, I’ve talked with quite a few people and it won’t be working as a SaaS, so I won’t pursue it.</p>

            <p>Link <a>bit.ly/1PKWmG9</a></p>
<p>Got what it does pretty easily.</p>
<p>First thoughts</p>
<ul>
<li>How would this work with CMS/blogging system [X] I am using</li>
<li>Personally - would only need this very occasionally (once a year?), so would be reluctant to pay any sort of monthly fee for it.</li>
<li>If I was in a business that needed this often I would have been sure to use a CMS/blogging sytem that supports it natively or at least has plugin to do so.</li>
</ul>
