    <title>Press releases - who do you use?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/press-releases-who-do-you-use/1945</link>
    <description>Just wondered: what do people use for press releases?

I&#39;ve found press releases to be fairly, but not enormously, useful in generating some interest and inbound links to my domains. Good enough to go back to anyway.

I&#39;ve always used PRWeb, but just wondered if there were any other more cost effective solutions? $249 for control over anchor text seems a bit excessive. I suppose my reticence in trying other services has been the question as to how much they actually distribute the PR in comparison with PRWeb.</description>

            <p>These guys must have scraped AngelList because I’ve gotten a (semi)personalized email from them, for every single one of my products: <a href="https://www.goprit.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.goprit.com/</a></p>
<p>Marketing gaffes aside, I thought their offering was fairly compelling.  I haven’t actually used them, but I’d be interested to hear others’ experiences.</p>
