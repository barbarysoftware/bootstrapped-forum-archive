    <title>Virtual Assistants - What do they do for you?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/virtual-assistants-what-do-they-do-for-you/692</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,

I&#39;ve been thinking about the VA thing. I have a feeling that having a VA on board could help reduce our workload. But I&#39;m having trouble thinking up actual tasks that they could do. 

For example, I&#39;d love to have someone book my travel (I travel a lot). But I don&#39;t want to hand over a CC to someone whom I don&#39;t know. 

If you have a VA, could you give me a few examples of actual tasks that they do to lighten your load? If you have them do complex things, was training a challenge?

            <p>Brian, that’s a great note about how to get organized before hiring your first VA. I’ll have to start a log. Repeatable tasks that are doable is key.</p>

            <p>The primary benefit of odesk for me has been the “automatic” payment system. Yea, they take a chunk off the top, but I love the convenience of my VA being able to log his hours and his pay is automatically deducted from my paypal via odesk.  I like not having to manually send payment, check hours, etc.</p>

            <p>I’ve had a full-time VA (Philippinnes) for a year and planning to hire a 2nd soon.</p>
<p>I’m the past, I made the mistake of hiring VA before I was ready.  I was very busy, but lacked systems and procedures.  The things that kept me busy weren’t repeatable processes, they were one time tasks.  So I struggled with delegation (it’s faster to do it myself than train him).</p>
<p>I learned its best spend a few months working “as if” you had a VA. As things come up in your work day that you’d like to delegate, add them to a running list (I use Trello). Do this for 3-6 months.</p>
<p>Then review the list and find the stuff that you do repeatedly. These are the things you’ll want to plan to give your VA.</p>
<p>When you’re nearly ready to make the hire, list out exactly what you plan to fill their plate for the first week. If you can’t fill 1 weeks worth of tasks, you’re not ready.</p>
<p>I also recommend coming up with a few “downtime” tasks. Things they can do (anytime) when you have nothing else for them to work on.  Social Media posting is a good one.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I have to say that the guy in the Philippines who works for us couldn’t be better. He’s very proactive and able to handle complex tasks without a ton of direction. It helps that his english is almost perfect.</p>
<p>That said, it seemed like a lot of the people I interviewed would have required a lot more direction on my part. I don’t think that they’re any less capable. I just think they’ve been trained to work in very hierarchical places where you do exactly what your told.</p>
<p>I’m in mexico now, and it’s kind of similar here. Horizontal organizations aren’t the norm.</p>

            <p>I’ve used a VA from the Philippines for over a year now.  I haven’t had any real cultural issues with her so far.  She is great at following a process document and doing independent research, given some specific criteria.  She’s works hard and meets my deadlines.  Maybe it’s just her being extra smart, but my friends who use Philippines VAs seem to have similar experiences.</p>

            <p>I work in Northern Italy, which, as a whole, is wealthier and more productive than the south.  There are a lot of reasons for this, and it’s complex, and so on.  I don’t think I’d hire VA’s in Italy just to keep my US-based bootstrapped business fairly detached from Italy.  As far as individuals go, I’ve met plenty of people from the south who were very smart, productive, etc…  So I think it’s mainly a question of environment.  But, that said, there are cultural differences, and I’m curious if the Philippines has something similar.</p>

            <p>Hey David,</p>
<p>I have worked with both Northern and Southern Italian VAs (and also with high-caliber designers and developers).</p>
<p><strong>In my experience</strong>, Southern have been far more hard working, talented and down to earth.  But this is just my experience: some of us know how delicate is the social situation between North and South in Italy.</p>
<p>How was your experience instead?</p>

<p>Yes, I think ultimately that if you get someone who is good, you want to stick with them.</p>

            <p>I’ve tried virtual assistants from a few different places.  Zirtual, Fancy Hands, and YourVirtualWorkers.  I’m currently using Fancy Hands and have found it a great resource to get random tasks done.</p>
<p>Despite many book, blogs and checklists from others, I’ve found it hard to know exactly how to use a VA in my business.  It’s an odd tension between needing to trust someone and also not needing to detail every single task.</p>
<p>When people ask me about VA’s I send them an email I’ve drafted.  I just posted that email to my blog and you can read it here <a href="http://gbake.com/lets-talk-virtual-assistants-aka-vas/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://gbake.com/lets-talk-virtual-assistants-aka-vas/</a></p>

            <p>Paying the VA has been a lot easier than I thought it would be. It’s really common in the Philippines for VA’s to have paypal accounts. So I just have them send me an invoice every 2 weeks and I pay via paypal.</p>

            <p>Interesting, sounds like you figured out a good approach - thanks for sharing it.</p>
<p>With VirtualAssistantFinder, how does paying the person you ended up selecting work - do you go through them, or are you on your own, or what?</p>

            <p>Just wanted to do a quick followup:</p>
<p>I’ve been working with my VA for about 6 weeks now, and overall I’m really happy with him. I think that VA is a bit of a misnomer. We’re really using him like we would use an entry-level marketing coordinator in the US.</p>
<p>For a long time I struggled to find tasks I could delegate. I think my problem was that I was thinking in chunks that were too large. Now, I’ve started to chunk things down, and it’s much easier to delegate. For example before I may have had a task to “talk with prospective advertisers.” Now I might break that into two tasks. “Identify &amp; create a list of advertisers” and “contact advertisers.” I can delegate the first one, so that I’m spending a greater % of time on the things I’m specifically good at.</p>
<p>It took a while to find someone I liked. At first, I investigated the different VA services. However I wanted someone answerable to me, not an agency. Also, I’m not convinced that they add much value. Next I tried Odesk. It took a lot of work to screen people and in the end I wasn’t very happy with any of my options. Finally, I coughed up $400 to VirtualAssistantFinder, which is a kind of matchmaker between employers and VAs in the Philippines. They’re definitely worth it because they do all of the pre-screening and give you several qualified applicants to choose from.</p>
<p>All I needed to do at that point was email everybody’s references and have a skype chat with the applicants. In my case, we had one candidate who was the obvious choice.</p>
<p>If anyone has any questions I’ll be happy to answer them.</p>

<p>I’ve been spending the last few weeks documenting processes for our business and coming up with tasks that I’d like some help with.</p>
<p>I posted a job on odesk and so far I have 3 decent applicants. While I definitely want to hire someone long-term, I’m not going to be in any rush to hire. If this hiring attempt fails, at least it’ll make a decent blog post.</p>

            <p>I think the key to Virtual Assistants is having the task broken down small enough that anyone can do it given time.  So for example I just had a VA do the following:<br>
Task 1. Do a search query on a particular site to create a list of contacts in a spreadsheet on google docs.<br>
Task 2. Send a specific templated email to the first 15 contacts in the list compiled in task 1.<br>
Task 3. Send a different email to the 2nd 15 contacts. (A/B testing, etc.)</p>
<p>Those are all small enough tasks that they require minimal documentation and were all done within a day just like I needed.</p>
<p>Granted, this is the only tasks I’ve had done yet. I’ll provide more details later, but given that I could go focus on other more critical and/or fun tasks while that was going on, I think it pays off big.</p>

            <p>I contact each lead with a semi-personalized e-mail. I try to look at each lead’s web presence, and address the message to them as personally as I can.  This is <strong>way</strong> slower than mail-merge, but I like to think it promotes higher quality interactions. My conscience also won’t let me mass e-mail without an opt-in list, so that’s also affecting things.</p>

            <p>Good find! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<p>Having read most of it now, I can say that it definitely could have used an editor. There’s about 15 pages of really good content mixed in with a bunch of pseudo-intellectual claptrap.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, I’ve found a lot of business books to be like this.</p>

            <p>Great use case, David.<br>
Question: How do you contact those leads? Phone, email each manually, or use mail merge services like <a href="http://www.talk2customers.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.talk2customers.com</a> ?</p>

            <p>For booking travel without handing over your card details, you could check if your credit card comes with a free Concierge / Personal Assistant service.  Amex Platinum cards usually come with it, but so do some Visa Platinum cards.  That’s generally what the concierge is there for, and that way your card details stay with a Visa/MC/Amex approved organization.</p>
<p>I tried a Virtual Assistant service a few years ago, but generally wasn’t very happy with the quality and had to do a lot of cleanup of spreadsheets/data myself.  Probably to be expected though, as I was only paying $10 - $15 US per hour.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/pdebruic">@pdebruic</a> Good point. I think I’ll do that.</p>
<p>If anyone’s looking for a book to read on the subject, “Work the System” is pretty good. The tropicalmba guy mentioned it in a podcast.</p>
<p>Here’s a non-af link: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Work-System-Simple-Mechanics-Working-ebook/dp/B002UUT3KQ/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.amazon.com/Work-System-Simple-Mechanics-Working-ebook/dp/B002UUT3KQ/</a></p>
<p>The systems approach makes a lot of sense. I’m going to start documenting our processes this week.</p>
