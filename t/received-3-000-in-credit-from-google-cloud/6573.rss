    <title>Received $3,000 in credit from Google Cloud</title>

    <description>As a founder of AXSAR Solo, I participated in Y-Combinator Startup School for over 9 weeks.

Apart from being a great program, they also lined up several good deals from big companies for the participating startups.

When it finished last week, I applied for the Google Cloud credits.

Today, I got the below email from Google Cloud:

&quot;Welcome to the Google Cloud Startup Program!

We&#39;re pleased to offer your company $3,000 in Start Google Cloud Platform Credits, which can be used for any core GCP product, plus Firebase. &quot;

I would highly recommend Y-Combinator Startup School, so do try to join it next year!

PS: AXSAR Solo is a CRM, and all-in-one workspace for small teams.</description>

            <p>It’s worth noting that you can’t just sign up to Startup School, you have to enroll in a course. Seems silly, but unless you enroll in a course you won’t get these benefits and won’t be able to post on their forum.</p>
