    <title>My interview on the UI Breakfast podcast</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/my-interview-on-the-ui-breakfast-podcast/7346</link>
    <description>I was [recently interviewed by Jane Portman for the UI Breakfast podcast](https://uibreakfast.com/198-desktop-apps-vs-web-apps-with-steve-mcleod/).

&gt; What are the main differences between running desktop apps versus web apps? And which of the two comes with less hassle and problems down the line? Our guest today is Steve McLeod, the founder of Feature Upvote and acquirer of Saber Feedback. You’ll hear Steve’s opinion on switching from desktop to web-based apps, the various maintenance and support issues that may arise, the “boring” aspects of running complex software, and how to prevent the stress that often comes with SaaS.
