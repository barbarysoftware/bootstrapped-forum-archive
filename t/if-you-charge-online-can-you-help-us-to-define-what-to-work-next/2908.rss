    <description>Hey gals &amp; guys,

[We][1]  have been preparing a general survey in order to understand more what are the current pains when it comes to charge online.

We built Quaderno to manage European VAT made over any Stripe charges, next weeks we are releasing something for PayPal, Paymill… But we want to go beyond that.

If you charge online, and you have a couple minutes free, it would mean the world to us if you can give us some insights &amp; feedback in this survey &gt; https://quaderno.typeform.com/to/wbMyiH 

Thanks!
