    <description>Following upon this post from October:
http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/my-new-product-hyper-plan/2158
I launched Hyper Plan v1 yesterday and made some sales. Hooray!

I put some more details about the launch here:

I would love to get some feedback, particularly on the website:

-first impressions
-do you understand what Hyper Plan does?
-does it look OK in your browser?

<p>You would know it wasn’t designed by designer but it doesn’t look that bad.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but a little unsure if it would be useful in my workflow. I’m currently using Omni Outliner as a lightweight project management tool - I needed hierarchical lists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>does it look OK in your browser?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks fine on Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera on OSX. It could be made responsive so it looks better on smartphones.</p>
<p>Just some thoughts that came to me about the website - the white strip with “Simple Visual Planning Software” looks a little plain, maybe using a fancier font might help. The icons and text below the video look good. I’m wondering would it be better to have the “Start a free trial now” button higher up the page. I found the video a little too long and going into too much detail, I wonder would it be better to show a walk through of a concrete use-case. You describe it as “As simple as sticking notes to a wall, but much more flexible” - I wonder could that idea be shown visually - a collage of post-it notes on a wall and the colour squares of your software. For the colour of links, would it be an idea to use the blue in your logo rather than the default blue?</p>

    I put out a beta of a new product today: 
<a href="http://www.hyperplan.com" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.hyperplan.com</a> 
It is a lightweight planning tool. It is a bit different from anything  else I have seen. I hope it will appeal to the event planners that use PerfectTablePlan (amongst others).I won’t say too much more. See if you can work it out from the website? 
It is a proof and concept and isn’t polished to commercial software standards. For example, there is no printing, no exporting and not much documentation. And there is plenty that co…
