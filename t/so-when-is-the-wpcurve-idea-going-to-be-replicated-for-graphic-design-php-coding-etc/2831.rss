    <description>I often find I need little bits of graphics work done, like &quot;remove a background from a photo&quot; or some simple php, or CSS.

Seems like there MIGHT be a market for that in the same way that that wpCurve works ($70/month fee for unlimited small jobs)</description>

            <p>Don’t have any plans at the moment to make the blog subscription more prominent on the website; it’s a personal thing, but I dislike sites that have announcement bar type plugins installed throughout or have pop-ups everywhere asking for subscriptions (exit intent pop-ups are an exception).</p>
<p>Cheers for the blog post idea, I’ll put that on the spreadsheet of ideas that’s rapidly growing!</p>

            <p>Excellent idea! Looks good.<br>
That’s great that you get the same person each time. That builds communication (and also a certain amount of “investment” and “lock in” for me, the customer. It’s a win-win.</p>
<p>One issue I run into is that my graphic design needs go in spurts.<br>
So I, personally, would probably sign up for a month or to, then put it on hold.</p>
<p>So… next time I am in “design mode”  I’ll give you folks a try.</p>
<p>BTW, have you considered making your newsletter more prominent on your website?<br>
As I mentioned, this is the kind of service that I’d file away as “use this next time I ____”, getting my attention once a month is a great idea.</p>
<p>I’m hoping your newsletter will have the Coolest New Graphics Trends.<br>
Basically “look at this cool new style”, wouldn’t that look great on your website?</p>
