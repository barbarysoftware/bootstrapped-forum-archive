    <title>Hi, Chris from UK here</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-chris-from-uk-here/5200</link>
    <description>Hi, Just joined the forum. Been boostrapping for the past 5 years, still haven&#39;t quite got there. Our first proper SaaS app launched earlier this June clienform and we&#39;re just looking at finding the product market fit as well as the best sales channels. Now looking at 2 new ideas, rocketproof and pricingrocket both in early validation stage and both aimed at fellow bootstrappers. Gonna post a request for feedback on the two new ideas once I can post links :slight_smile:

Also looking forward to sharing and helping out others.</description>
