    <description>[I interviewed Kevin McArdle of SureSwift Capital in episode 146](https://bootstrapped.fm/146-selling-your-business-at-any-revenue-level-with-kevin-mcardle-of-sureswift-capital/).

Kevin has a monthly email for founders and I highly recommend it. You can sign up here: http://www.sureswiftcapital.com/join/?utm_source=forward

It is typically full of useful tips you can apply to your business. The tips come from the system that Kevin&#39;s team uses to run 30+ SaaS companies in their portfolio.</description>
