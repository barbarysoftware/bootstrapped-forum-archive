    <description>Amir Salihefendic, founder of Doist has [an excellent article about some of the negative aspects of remote working](https://doist.com/blog/mental-health-and-remote-work/) (or solo working) and how to deal with them:

&gt; It got to the point where I realized I had to make drastic changes for the sake of my mental health, so I rented an office close to the university. Yes, I was still just working by myself in a different place. And yes, it cost more than just working from home and added a commute into my day. But it was worth every penny and minute. I needed that hard physical separation between work and the rest of my life. Work had a definite start and end time. Getting out of my apartment made me more social again as I would do lunches, dinners, or sports with friends while I was already out. Slowly the good days started coming back. I began showing up to work with energy again. Stressors became easier to handle.</description>
