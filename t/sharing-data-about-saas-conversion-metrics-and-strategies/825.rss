    <title>Sharing data about SaaS conversion metrics and strategies</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/sharing-data-about-saas-conversion-metrics-and-strategies/825</link>
    <description>Groove are organising a SaaS metrics survey - conversion rates and customer acquisition strategies etc for bootstrapped SaaS business. The idea is you share some of your data (anonymously) and then get access to the aggregated data that allows you to benchmark your activity against the market. Neat idea and they have had over 500 participants so far so it looks like there will be a good deal of useful info to come out. Deadline to submit your information is 31st December. 

I think this is a great idea in any case though I should declare an interest - Alex Turnbull, Groove&#39;s CEO decided to purchase two tickets to our Business of Software Conference in Boston next September to be given away as a prize (along with a whole load of other things) to one participant chosen at random who completes the survey.

[Worth a look I think][1].
