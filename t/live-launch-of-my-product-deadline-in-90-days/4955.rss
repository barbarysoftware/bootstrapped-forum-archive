    <title>Live launch of my product - deadline in 90 days</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/live-launch-of-my-product-deadline-in-90-days/4955</link>
    <description>Greetings all,

So I had an idea on Saturday (2017/04/22) and I decided to go about it another way that I would normally do it, just do it.

I got some inspiration from Russell Westbrook breaking the record for most triple doubles with his statement &quot;Why Not?&quot;

If you are sick of reading blogs and watching training videos, hopefully this thread will give you some inspiration and real life guidance.

So this is a **scratch your own itch product**, it is something need all the time but there is no product out there that really fits the bill for me personally.

I will update this thread as I go, a live launch as you will :slight_smile:

The product name/domain is: [spoiler]not just yet sorry lol[/spoiler]

Timeline:

## April 22nd Saturday
3:45PM
&quot;Why not&quot; kind of popped into my head - let&#39;s make a MVP of this thing that I really want to build.  I searched around for a name that I liked and registered the domain name.

So I have been working on this &quot;long-term&quot; SaaS app for about 1 year now on/off, so I have allot of experience will setting things up the way I want it.  And but that I mean AUTOMATION.   I can&#39;t stand to repeat doing things over and over, so b/c of this I was able to get allot of done in a short period of time.
Here is what I did on saturday.

* find a good domain name/ app name that I like
* update the DNS to AWS
* setup the automation of my app&#39;s dns, ec2 servers, database and filesystem.
* setup SSL on the domain
* `rails new xxx -T --database=postgresql`
* fired off an email to rackspace to setup my domain and email


## April 23rd Sunday
Today I wanted to get something live as soon as possible.  I am a very visual person and once I see something *live* - no matter WHAT it is - it gets my creative juices going.  I was able to get my deployment process setup on AWS to push code out to my server.  This is a MVP, lean and mean as it gets so I really didn&#39;t care that my default page was showing the usual rails home#index view content :) 

Now that my app was somewhat setup, I did a git init and setup my git server and pushed my first commit.

I am not a stickler for this project just *yet*, so this is all spike coding with 0 tests!
## April 24th Monday
So this is where I can&#39;t really say what I did as it will expose the idea - and I am waiting to get a simple homepage designed / launch page before I will go into more details.

But my app is live, I setup the load balancer with the domain and it is up and running.
I got to ssh into my box and run some rake tasks/console just to make sure I can connect to the db if need be for one-off emergency tasks.

## April 25th Tuesday
Today I wanted to get a skeleton structure of the admin section where users will log into.  So I setup and account model and very basic authentication.

&gt; git merge feature/admin_skeleon

## April 26th Wednesday

&gt; git checkout -b feature/themes

Started a new git branch to work on a custom theme engine.  I was able to get allot done in a very short period of time once again b/c I have been mentally going over this for a few months prior :) .
I have a very rough prototype of it working locally, just going to start working the the admin piece so I can edit themes w/o having to push changes to the app.


I hope you guys enjoy this thread, I am pretty excited to publicly commit to this.

P.S

Sorry if this isn&#39;t worded that nicely, I just though of this idea and fired it off :airplane:

More to come....

            <h2>April 27th Thursday</h2>
<p>So I continued working on the git branch feature/themes.  Because this was in the admin section I ended up having to code some mock objects for the admin user who is logged in, along with what account they represent so it loads the correct data for them.</p>
<p>I was able to pull in the same admin html template from my other project, so I now have a decent looking admin section which again gives me some encouragement (I’m a visual person!).</p>
<p>Here is a quick screenshot of what the theme editing looks like so far:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/bootstrapped/original/2X/8/8efe717419fc70ccbe638982e06bdfa96adaf44a.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/koYWs7b79Afhz9GNcKMQI2Qzgh4.png?dl=1" title="Screen Shot 2017-04-27 at 7.37.13 PM.png"><img src="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/bootstrapped/optimized/2X/8/8efe717419fc70ccbe638982e06bdfa96adaf44a_2_690x367.png" alt data-base62-sha1="koYWs7b79Afhz9GNcKMQI2Qzgh4" width="690" height="367" srcset="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/bootstrapped/optimized/2X/8/8efe717419fc70ccbe638982e06bdfa96adaf44a_2_690x367.png, https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/bootstrapped/original/2X/8/8efe717419fc70ccbe638982e06bdfa96adaf44a.png 1.5x, https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/bootstrapped/original/2X/8/8efe717419fc70ccbe638982e06bdfa96adaf44a.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/bootstrapped/optimized/2X/8/8efe717419fc70ccbe638982e06bdfa96adaf44a_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">Screen Shot 2017-04-27 at 7.37.13 PM.png</span><span class="informations">910×485 15.2 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>It isn’t production ready yet but just having a decent looking template goes a long way.</p>
<p>Next up I think it is time to work on the account, session, permissions and then plans + stripe integration.</p>
<p>I will probably be going back and forth between those features as the need arises, but I hope to get them done in the coming 2 weeks as allot of the code will be pulled in from my other project.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking this little journey with me <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
