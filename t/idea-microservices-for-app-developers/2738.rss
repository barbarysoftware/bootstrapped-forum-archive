    <title>Idea: Microservices for App Developers</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/idea-microservices-for-app-developers/2738</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been building iOS applications since 2009 and hacked together a bunch of Micro-services (to use a buzz word) for various apps. I&#39;ll take the most useful and generic and wrap these into a SaaS platform for app developers. 

I&#39;ve developed a range of useful solution from form to mail, through to analytics and event tracking. Not all of these are useful for every application but most are used at least once. I find myself relying on these APIs to develop applications quickly. Services would include: 

* form to email (support and contact form)
* remote configuration delivery (with OS library)
* API cache proxy (help control costs for paid APIs when during download spikes) 
* usage stats per version (not everyone is happy with GA and other tracking solutions) 
* more TBC

**Who is the ideal customer?** 
Contracting app developers, indie developers. Contractors can use the same API for rinse and repeat development. Indies can not worry about building web services. 

**What pain does the product solve?**
As above. In general terms it is useful to have a set of APIs to help when developing applications. All of these services are provided elsewhere but integration can be tricky - or complex often for a simple need. 

**How will it make money?**
Freemium SaaS service 

**What is the early-stage path to market**
Free tier of services to validate idea - introduce paid services later. Content marketing of solving this problem in a generic way. 

**Limitations of the Idea**
This is not a backend as a service like parse.com or similar - but a helping hand. Users may expect more then it provides.</description>

            <p>MBaaS is Mobile Back-end As A Service. Usually a database of some sort (though sometimes those are called DBaaS), but more aimed at the needs of mobile developers. I think there are some real needs in this area, but I’m a back-end guy, and know very little about mobile development.</p>
<p>Kinvey is interesting, and there’s also Kony, but I bet for a bootstrapper, there’s needs to be filled that these (VC-backed – $100mil for Kony) I’m sure don’t meet.</p>

            <p>So I think they haven’t taken off because for it to be a fundable unicorn megacorp idea you need a large market - a large market needs big apps running off of it. Big apps need big infrastructure and general APIs.</p>
<p>The closest thing that I can think of is <a href="http://helios.io" rel="nofollow noopener">http://helios.io</a> - this is essentially a set of libraries that provide a bunch of very specific tools to achieve common things in an application.</p>
<p>The trick is to be able to understand what are the common simple things that need to be implemented without creating vast general APIs that others do - like <a href="http://parse.com" rel="nofollow noopener">parse.com</a> etc.</p>
<p>Finally, what the hell is mBaaS, is it a post-puberty rendition of mmmBop?</p>

            <p>I had a similar idea of starting a contracting business with just offering server-side development. There are plenty iOS and Android developers whose apps need web services, but not many server coders who also know the client-side development. But the difficulty would be finding people who are good at developing in both worlds, I’m not too confident about their availability.</p>

            <p>John,<br>
Have you tried to present this idea to other mobile developers? If so, what level of interest have they demonstrated?</p>

            <p>Parse Core, focuses around data synchronisation and social logins, their analytics is a fully blown analytics package, and they also have a very good push notification platform. They offer the ability to run a cross platform backend in the cloud.</p>
<p>I’d suggest that this is over the top for 90% of the applications out there. Imagine an app that doesn’t need cross platform data sync or social logins - say a game, company brochure app, or small utility - calculator, pedometer etc. These are the applications that can benefit.</p>
