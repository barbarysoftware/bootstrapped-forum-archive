    <description>Hi fellow bootstrappers,

A year ago we used this forum to get first feedback on [SatisMeter][1] - an in-app customer feedback tool for SaaS businesses. I thought it might be interesting for some of you to know what worked for us and what did not.

We started accepting payments last month and so far received $1300 in MRR from 14 companies. Our goal is to reach $3000 MRR which will allow us going full-time on SatisMeter.

How did we get our first customers:

- We applied for partnership with [Segment][2] to make survey installation easier for our customers. Once they published us among their integrations we started getting consistent traffic with very high conversion rate.
- We tried to talk to everybody who signed-up and build the product based on what we heard. Our initial customers were designing parts of the product with us.

How did we reach more customers:

- Our customers were happy with us. The gave [talks about growth hacks using SatisMeter][3]. They [recommended us][4]. They [published articles about Net Promoter mentioning us][5] and [blog posts on creative product integrations][6].
- We have “Powered by SatisMeter” footer in each survey we serve. Surprisingly this works very well and we receive a lot of traffic through this channel.
- One of our customer posted us on [ProductHunt][7]. We received over 100 upvotes and 150 new sign-ups.

What did not work that well:

- Advertisements - when we launched we wanted to get some traffic quickly so we invested in google, twitter and linkedin ads. We got just a few small companies signed-up through these and the ads were very expensive. We stopped that after a month.
- App directories - there are many places where you can register SaaS product and people can comment/rate on them. We added SatisMeter to tens to those but none of them brought significant  traffic.
- Blog - we wanted to create a blog to drive some traffic but we did not have energy to create interesting content. We use it mostly for product announcements.

I hope you find this post useful. I’d be glad to hear your comments or hints.

Cheers,
Jakub

<p>The setup you mentioned sounds interesting. I was aware there are more advanced targeting options, but did not realize you can target based on company. Do you have any interesting links on this topic?</p>

            <p>thanks for sharing <a class="mention" href="/u/sedlacek_jakub">@sedlacek_jakub</a>! Very interesting stuff.<br>
I have a question about your failed advertisements. how targeted were your ads? Did you figure out a niche target customer (e.g. get data from builtwith, and select only companies that use technology X, because if they use X they might like SatisMeter) and targeted your ads only to them?</p>
