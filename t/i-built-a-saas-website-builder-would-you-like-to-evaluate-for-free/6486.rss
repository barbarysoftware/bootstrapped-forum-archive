    <title>I built a SaaS Website Builder - would you like to evaluate for free?</title>

    <description>Hello Everyone, I just built [SaaSBox](https://saasbox.net) and looking for early adopters to try it out. Using SaaSBox you can create an online subscription business using Stripe. SaaSBox handles:

* User login, sign up, user management
* Stripe plan creation and management. Your pricing page updates dynamically when you fill out a form - handy if you frequently change prices/features.
* Sell digital products (e-book and so on while you figure out the subscription business, here is an [article](https://stackingthebricks.com/why-you-should-do-a-tiny-product-first/) by Amy Hoy for why you might want to do that) 
* The frontend html template feature might be interesting. You can switch between site appearances, or share yours with community, and use other&#39;s designs. There is a growing list of sample templates.
* Create landing &amp; other pages filling out forms.
* Use your own domain with HTTPS.
* A free blog which is a serious blog solution.

It is a no-code tool made for simplifying all the generics of running a SaaS business. Right now it is free and I am looking for beta users.

If you try it out I will incorporate new features based on your feedback. Let me know what you think!

Cheers!
Bahadir Balban

            <p>Hi Christoph, thanks for the welcome, this is a useful community sure to grow. I especially prefer a forum with real faces to reddit, and small means more real conversations!</p>
<p>It started as a template similar to Bullettrain and now it is hosted. I am aiming to help non-programmers who want to start out with a Stripe subscription business with users.</p>

            <p>Bahadir, congrats on launching and welcome to our little community here. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Is this similar to <a href="http://Bullettrain.co">Bullettrain.co</a> but for Node?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback. It started as a template for developers, and now it is fully hosted and aimed at non-programmers. I am going to reflect that in the landing page.</p>

            <p>If I understand correctly, this requires NodeJS?</p>
<p>If so, that should definitely be in your landing page headline.</p>
<p>First, it saves pointless enquiries from Java developers like myself. That means less support work for you.</p>
<p>Second, it helps people using NodeJS to find you and to know they are in the right place. Oh, and Google will more likely send the right people to you.</p>
