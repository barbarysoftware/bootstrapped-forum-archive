            <p>The guy who wrote the post seems not to understand finance, accounting, and international tax very well. Nor do I, but I do know that by moving to Singapore he doesn’t legally gain an exemption from EU VAT rules. However he <em>can</em> safely ignore the VAT rules without risk of retribution. Also, he is an idiot for having publicly blogged that he is flouting the rules.</p>
<p>I’m in Spain; I charge EU customers VAT and submit the tax collected through the VATMOSS process. My competitors are based in the USA; they don’t charge EU customers VAT. They should but they don’t, giving them a price advantage. Sigh.</p>
<p>(Here’s a good reason not to move to Singapore: its government is <em>rather</em> authoritarian. Mandatory death penalty for certain crimes; caning for others.)</p>
<p>Finally, a much simpler solution than implementing VATMOSS rules, or moving to another country to dodge them, is to use FastSpring.</p>
