    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Thibaut from WiseCash</title>

    <description>Hi!

I&#39;m Thibaut, and I&#39;ve bootstrapped [WiseCash][1], a handy SaaS app to forecast your cash flow, make informed decisions, and handle your freelancing/small business with more peace of mind. I built WiseCash with my wife, based on our experience running a small business since 2005.

WiseCash was in private beta for one year and opened to the public beginning of July. We are growing gently at this point, and I&#39;m actively working at reaching financial independence based solely on our product (our main income is still coming from freelancing at this point).

Like Mathias from Travis CI, I&#39;m a 30x500 alumni where I learned quite a bit.

I&#39;m located in a very rural area of France (north of Bordeaux). We relocated there to improve our quality of life (we have 2 kids) and make bootstrapping less financially challenging.

I started doing side-projects when my first son was born, and I shipped WiseCash (my first SaaS) when my second son was born. They are kicking our asses to improve our lifestyle :-)

I&#39;m very glad to have discovered this forum. Lots of positive and energizing discussions here!

Cheers, Thibaut
