    <title>Recommendations for Professional Indemnity / General Liability insurance?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/recommendations-for-professional-indemnity-general-liability-insurance/1625</link>
    <description>Before we go live with our product, I&#39;d like to have some good insurance in place.

Here in New Zealand, a local insurance broker has provided quotes ranging from around USD$2,500 for $1M cover, to USD$5000 for $5M cover.

Does anyone want to share approximate insurance costs from their businesses? I don&#39;t know whether US-based insurers would want to cover us being based in NZ, but it&#39;s an increasingly global world &amp; worth a look before we sign up locally.

So that we&#39;re comparing apples to apples: our quotes were for a SaaS Personal Financial Management product.

Thanks, Darren.</description>

            <p>I think we pay around $350 USD/mo for $2MM liability insurance.  Used this broker: <a href="http://www.techinsurance.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.techinsurance.com/</a></p>
