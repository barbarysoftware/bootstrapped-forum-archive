    <title>Guide: What you should know as a founder of a software company</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/guide-what-you-should-know-as-a-founder-of-a-software-company/5388</link>
    <description>I tried to distill the essence of my entrepreneur experience into a single guide:

https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/

Hopefully it&#39;s ok to continue posting some of my articles here because many of them will be bootstrapping-related, but I can stick to one forum thread in the future if it&#39;s too self-promotional to create a new one for each.</description>

            <p>Ivan, +1 on your post - I like your structure (and content): the Recommendations: subheading helps to make the content more actionable.</p>

            <p>Interesting article.</p>
<p>Have something to add about Germany though: It’s not only high income taxes but also absurdly high (mandatory) health care contributions that are at 15% of your GROSS income (though they’re capped at ~780 EUR/Month). The problem is that once you start a business they automatically assume that you have an income of at least ~2500 Euros so the minimum you have to pay is around 400 Euros/month even if you have in fact 0 income still. (No, you can’t get a lower rate than that. That’s the bottom rate for self employed people who are not on social security assistance).</p>
<p>This makes bootstrapping a nightmare in Germany.</p>
<p>(Now this is for the public health insurance. There are private health insurances that don’t have this fee structure but from experience they get more expensive if you’re past the age of 30.)</p>

            <p>Thanks, a content table sounds great for a post with 10 subheadings. I think we’ll explore each topic in a separate post in the future and update the guide with links to them. From what I’ve read, Google likes 2k+ words articles nowadays – so the current amount of content is not enough to split it into pages.</p>

<p>Oh, you’re trying to make it a guide? Then it should be better structured - content table and whatnot. Without a way to navigate the structure it is just a post, and for a post it is lengthy and doesn’t make only one point (as a post should do).</p>
<p>Note: I’m not questioning the quality of info - which is very good! - just the accessibility and format. I believe you’d make more service for a reader and get more Google juice if you split the data in separate pages, navigable from a main “guide” page.</p>

<p>So, it feels a bit like running a company? Then it’s a feature, not a bug! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Some provided resources are very cool!</p>
<p>However, I felt that the post was way too long, and still (not a surprise for such a huge subject) failed to cover all the bases. It left a feeling of jumping from topic to topic. I feel if split into a few posts it could have provided better details and read more clearly.</p>

            <p>Its a very good article and certainly chimes with my experiences over the last 12 years.</p>

            <p>Almost – I don’t want to publish anything in November or December when big companies occupy all the media channels and people shift their attention to holidays. The goal is one blog post and one guest post monthly in 2018.</p>
<p>The previous article is an outlier because it’s relevant to everybody. I don’t think we can repeat this level of virality with something centered around productivity. But the result is 80k unique visitors and +$5k in sales already. I wish I had some app for Windows too. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/roll_eyes.png?v=5" title=":roll_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":roll_eyes:">  What’s also important: it led to hundreds of quality backlinks.</p>
<p>We also made a side project in a week. I haven’t promoted it except for Product Hunt and a couple of subreddits but it got its own article in Lifehacker and there’s a Qbserve banner in the extension options:<br>

<p>See how much money you could make if you were working instead</p>

            <p>Almost one month to the day since you published your previous article. Do I sense a strategy to release one long blog post every month? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If you don’t mind sharing, do you think <a href="https://qotoqot.com/blog/improving-focus/">your previous article</a> caused  a boost in Qbserve sales?</p>

            <p>I tried to distill the essence of my entrepreneur experience into a single guide:</p>

<h3><a href="https://qotoqot.com/blog/founder-skills/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">What you should know as a founder of a software company</a></h3>

<p>A guide to the complex world of modern software business</p>

<p>Hopefully it’s ok to continue posting some of my articles here because many of them will be bootstrapping-related, but I can stick to one forum thread in the future if it’s too self-promotional to create a new one for each.</p>
