    <description>We&#39;ve added a new category to the forum: [**&quot;Buying &amp; Selling&quot;**](http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/c/buying-and-selling)

It&#39;s a place for you to post your bootstrapped businesses for sale, and a place where you can post your interest in purchasing a bootstrapped business. It is not our intent to play middle-man in any way that would affect the potential resulting transaction. We just wanted to give you a place to post your offering or interest, browse existing listings, and connect as needed.</description>
