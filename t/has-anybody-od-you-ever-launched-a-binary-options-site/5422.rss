    <description>Hello guys,

I am thinking to create a binary options site. The main reason for this is that I see a lot of demand for this within the space of cryptocurrencies.

Has anybody of you launched such a site or has some experience? What are the most important factors when considering such a project?

Appreciate your replies!</description>
