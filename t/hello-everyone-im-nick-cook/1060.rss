    <title>Hello everyone, I&#39;m Nick Cook</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hello-everyone-im-nick-cook/1060</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, I&#39;m Nick Cook.  I&#39;ve been on the &#39;other&#39; side of IT for over 10 years now - doing IT sysadmin duties for various companies and been out running my own IT consulting firm for about 3 years now.

I&#39;ve always been interested in building a product, I even lurked the Joel boards back in the day. I&#39;ve been focusing on learning Rails over the last few months and trying to get a rough prototype product built.  I&#39;m having a great time, and am finding the whole bootstrapped community full of amazing people.   

I hope to be able to contribute and learn from everyone here!
