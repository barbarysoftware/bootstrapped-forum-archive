    <description>Continuing the discussion from [Announcing Blocks today](http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/announcing-blocks-today/1445/8):

[quote=&quot;gweedo, post:8, topic:1445, full:true&quot;]
over 50% of developers are willing to take bitcoin as payment could be a big market.
[/quote]

Is there a citation for this?

I&#39;d find any number over 5% to be shocking.

            <p>I am sorry there so much hostile towards bitcoins, being a bitcoin angel investor, 3 time bitcoin business starter and being apart of the bitcoin community for over 3yrs, I was hoping to learn much from this forum especially after much validation from square, overstock and VC’s. I guess we still have a lot to prove.</p>
<p>Thank you all for weighting in.</p>

            <p>The survey asked “would you be interested” not “would you accept”.</p>
<p>I’m interested in accepting bit coin and other cryptocurrencies but wouldn’t accept it as payment until the platform matures. I guess that was asked in the survey but still, something smells off about this.</p>
<p>90% of developers I know don’t even have a wallet or wouldn’t know how to open one.</p>
<p>Didn’t mean to start a heated discussion.<img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>It was a self selecting survey. It even says so down below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s possible that the most enthusiastic bitcoin supporters were the most motivated to respond to the Truth in Motion survey, which would have skewed the results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then they try to quote a PR firm, which thinks that a self selecting group may not be biased because " <em>the membership covers a fairly wide cross-section of IT firms</em>", as if that would overcome the bias.</p>

<p>I agree. First the growth hackers, now the Bitcoiners. Who’s next? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>Well I guess you both have been proven wrong. I don’t want to derail this topic, but if you want to speak to why bitcoin isn’t a real money I would gladly have a friendly debate about it in another thread.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

</aside>
<p>The person who made that claim is, for lack of a better term, a “bitcoin salesman / consultant”.</p>
<p>I think the actual number is closer to 0.00%. My source? Real developers need to eat, need to pay rent, to travel. If I’m living in the real world, I want to be paid real money.</p>
