    <description>http://www.ProductChart.com

This has been brewing as a side project since March last year when I first did a chart of the 200 most popular flash drives. Called it &quot;The tourist map of flashdrives&quot; at that time. Added more products and the interactive filters later in the year. Every time it got good responses and even some press outlets picked it up.

So I decided to turn this into a full fledged project on its own this year. Got a proper domain name and made a homepage for it. So here it is. ProductChart.com!

Mission statement: For every product type, provide a nice overview of what is available in the market, plus the filters to choose the perfect product.

Feedback would be very welcome. I still have to decide if I brand it as &quot;Product Chart&quot;, &quot;ProductChart&quot; or &quot;ProductChart.com&quot;. Any opinions?</description>
