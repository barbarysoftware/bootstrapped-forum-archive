    <title>Hey! I&#39;m Josh Crowder from Serious Fox</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hey-im-josh-crowder-from-serious-fox/370</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m Josh and I run a web development boutique in London called Serious Fox. We mainly work on client projects building Ruby on Rails applications but have been spending more time recently working on complex front ends predominantly in Backbone. We&#39;ve been bootstrapped since 2009 and have a grown our team from two to six. Over the years we have launched a couple of projects to varying success but none have allowed us to stop doing client work, our aim this year is to build something we love and need which is a project management tool called [Matterhorn.io][1].

Thanks for starting this forum looking forward to hearing peoples thoughts and experiences.
