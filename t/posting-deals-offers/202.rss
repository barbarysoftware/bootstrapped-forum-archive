    <description>Should we have some sort of &quot;Deals&quot; or &quot;Offers&quot; category for the community to post deals to either our own software or stuff we find around the web?

Or would we rather just keep that stuff out?</description>

            <p>Agreed I’m not a fan of the threads of just deals on our products. Keep it in introductions or product updates if anything.</p>
<p>Maybe deals on conferences that are tied in can be moderated and put into our meta category as sticky while they are relevant.</p>

            <p>Agreed, maybe for now people could add it to their personal “Introduction” if they really want to reward people from here.</p>
<p>Or, keep it really specifically tied to a posting of something that they genuinely want feedback on. E.g. “We’re launching this new way of doing blah blah blah, if you guys use PROMOBSTP on the sign-up page you can get in for free for 15 days to give me feedback”. As long as its not icky <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>My own take would be to keep that out for now. It’s early and I think it wouldn’t be a good experience for new users to come on for the first time and the latest view is full of 10% off posts. I also think there will be a lot of value for people who participate regularly here far beyond the one time incremental value of a discount, etc. Certainly open to others thoughts on this though.</p>
