    <title>Show Bootstrapped: Introducing SeeLink - A Link Sharing and Collaboration Platform</title>

    <description>Hello Bootstrapped Community!

I&#39;m proud to introduce a web-app I&#39;ve been working on for the past few months, SeeLink.

SeeLink is a link sharing and collaboration platform that enables you to save and share links from all around the web.

**What&#39;s SeeLink For?**

SeeLink is one of the first link sharing and collaboration platforms. SeeLink enables its users to store, share, and save links from all around the web. You could use SeeLink to store links of your interest, and share them with friends, family, or teammates.

**Why was SeeLink created?**

SeeLink was created to simplify sharing links with friends and family. Conventionally, sharing links with people was done through messaging apps, where they would get lost in the sea of messages. SeeLink allows its users to create boards to share links with specific people, allowing them to save and share human-readable links at the click of a button.

There&#39;s still a lot that I&#39;d like to improve in SeeLink, and if there&#39;s anything you&#39;d like to see added to that list, please let me know! Also, I&#39;m looking to get some user feedback before I launch to more people, so all feedback is welcome!

You can join SeeLink and try it out at the seelink.app (not hyperlinked as new users aren&#39;t allowed to put links in posts, for some reason)!

Thanks.</description>
