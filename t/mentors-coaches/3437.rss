    <title>Mentors/coaches</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/mentors-coaches/3437</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve always thought it interesting that Ramit Sethi claims to have flown from New York to LA once a month or whatever for a 45-minute mentorship meeting with Jay Abraham, which also cost like $10,000 or something (I don&#39;t remember). I&#39;m not ready for THAT, but I find it interesting that Ramit supposedly did that - and judging by Ramit&#39;s success, apparently the meetings worked.

I&#39;ve been feeling disoriented lately and I think I could really benefit from a seasoned mentor in addition to the feedback I get from all you wonderful people.

I wonder, do any of you guys use mentors/coaches? How did you find them? Do you pay your coach?</description>

            <p>It’s not the same thing, but a Mastermind group is among the best things I ever did for my business. You find one, two or three other people who are at a similar stage, and you meet in Skype or in person regularly.</p>
<p>Also, I’m a big fan of one-off coaching sessions. In 2011, I hired <a href="http://successfulsoftware.net/hire-my-brain/" rel="nofollow noopener">Andy Brice</a> for a day to have a look over my business and give me specific steps for improvement. That was a great experience. After the session I had a feeling of clarity and motivation, and that lasted for half a year.<br>
So in my experience, if you’re feeling disoriented, yes, you may benefit from coaching or a Mastermind group.</p>
