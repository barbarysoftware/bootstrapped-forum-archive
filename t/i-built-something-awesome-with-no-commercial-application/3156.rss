    <title>I Built Something Awesome... WIth No Commercial Application</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/i-built-something-awesome-with-no-commercial-application/3156</link>
    <description>Hey y&#39;all, need some help here.

A while back, I built http://printshop.io to leverage a cool physical world API over at http://theprintful.com. Thing is... nobody ever buys anything. Lots of pinterest action, some etsy and website views, but so few sales. It&#39;s been up over 2 years now. 

My question is, what could I use the tech for in a business application? Anything? Or should I just shut it down?</description>

            <p>My first impression when I landed on your page is that it’s something like Canva (Obviously it’s not) I’d state what you’re selling very clearly in the headline. Something Dr. Flint from Marketing Experiments said: “Clarity trumps persuasion.”</p>

            <p>Well trying to customize anything took forever to re-preview for me and one time appears to have not worked at all. I’m sure most people just leave. Something like that probably needs to be instant.</p>
<p>Though, that’s probably just secondary. Are you really pushing this thing or it’s just a cool thing you built? Because cool things you build but which don’t have a way to gain traction on their own and which you aren’t marketing don’t go anywhere.</p>
<p>Also, generally businesses built on top of other businesses are tricky. There can’t be much margin on any of this, so you really would have to sell a heck of a lot of tshirts to make any money at all.</p>

            <p>The nearest Add to Cart button was well below the fold. I wasn’t even sure you sell anything. That may explain the shortage of sales.</p>
<p>Also, I have lost in your cool-looking navigation. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> The top stripe with the examples is especially annoying – it shows parts of the designs on top and bottom, so it feels like I can scroll it (but I cannot). In gallery the Order By is always “Newest” - why make it look like a button if it is not a button? In short, the UX is suboptimal.</p>
<p>If I want to find something how can I? There is no search…</p>
<p>Just my random notes.</p>
<p>The competitors sites look simpler, but so much more efficient in dragging me to the buy button.</p>
