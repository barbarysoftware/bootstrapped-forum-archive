    <title>Greetings from the 3rd World</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/greetings-from-the-3rd-world/7540</link>
    <description>Hey bootstrapped, this is Mike, from Mexico.

I&#39;m an entrepreneur building  projects. I&#39;ve been launching different projects in the last few months, but I always encounter issues to get the first customers without unpaid marketing. 

The one that I&#39;m working on at this time is &quot;iSawDesign&quot;. It&#39;s an unlimited web design and graphic design service for startups

I&#39;m really good when it comes to Google Ads and Facebook campaigns, but I&#39;ve found it to be nearly impossible to invest in these when targeting the US market.

If you have any advice as to how y&#39;all have acquired the first few customers, please share the knowledge :smiley:
