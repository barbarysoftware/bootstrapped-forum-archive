    <title>New product &quot;Continuous Speed Test&quot;</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/new-product-continuous-speed-test/6956</link>
    <description>Hello, I have started a new project here: http://startrinity.com/InternetQuality/ContinuousBandwidthTester.aspx

it is a tool to continuously test quality of internet connection. 
I did not work yet on web design of this webpage, UI and UX of the app.  Can you please take a look? 

Does the product clear to a user ? How can I clean the UI and web page? Also do you have any ideas for making money out of this app and its possible pricing?

This product could change industry of &quot;internet speed testing&quot; and improve overall quality of internet around the world

Thanks</description>

</aside>
<p>I’m not saying there are no cases where this test can help.</p>
<p>What I’m saying there are IMHO not enough cases to make it a market.</p>
<p>From that already small number of cases you’d be able to reach out only to a fraction, and only a fraction of them would decide to buy instead of using a one-off solution like continuous download of /dev/random.</p>

            <p>I understand your point, but I see that the market exists:</p>
<p>The Continuous Speed Test helped me narrow down a problem that had been plaguing my system for months…an intermittent failure of a wireless card on one of my computers. The card only failed - and briefly - when a significant amount of data was being transferred through it. So, I set up the Continous Speed Test on the impacted device and on a laptop connected to the same WiFi. The failures on the Speech Test were obvious and helped me trace down the problem. I swapped out the bad card and the problem was fixed! Thank you!</p>

            <p>the website contains multiple products, each with different goals. yes, to get a better idea about internet connection.   I will work on UX with a designer, sure.  The simplicity of all “speed tests” today hides many problems, when internet is not stable in long term. My long-term goal is to tell users “what is wrong and what to do if they have bad internet connection” - change provider, change hardware, move wifi router, etc</p>

<p>That is a modest goal, I should say. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>A good start may be the OOKLA’s SpeedTest Enterprise: <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/enterprise">https://www.speedtest.net/enterprise</a></p>
<p>I doubt though that you have the resources required to compete with them.</p>
<p>Do smaller folks ever need a continuous speed test?</p>
<p>Home users - probably next to never. Maybe once in a few years, and only if someone in the household is a nerd.</p>
<p>Small businesses - maybe some, like adding networks to POS. And even then I’d guess they just do a short test (with existing solutions).</p>
<p>Man, I just can’t see common enough use-cases. What you listed on the site are, methinks, odd cases happening for a few people once in a long while.</p>
<p>I think - not enough market.</p>

            <p>The site needs a lot of work on the frontend and marketing.</p>
<p>The main issue it is it not really clear what is the point of the site? Is it to give you a better idea of how good your internet connection is?</p>
<p>I personally use <a href="https://fast.com/">https://fast.com/</a> it is really simple to use.</p>
<p>Your site is very technical, I am a web developer and I don’t understand what a lot of the app does.</p>
<p>I think you need to get together with a UX designer to come up with a better design for the site.</p>
<p>You should talk to <a href="https://nicolaifleischhauer.com/">https://nicolaifleischhauer.com/</a> he is a nice guy and he speaks Russian as well.</p>
