    <title>Hey, I&#39;m Adam – trying to launch a server monitoring business</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hey-im-adam-trying-to-launch-a-server-monitoring-business/2061</link>
    <description>Hi all,

My name is Adam and I have been building small web apps to test out my ideas for a few years. I have been writing PHP for about 8 years, wrote a book on the CodeIgniter framework and I now work as a Technical Writer full time. I have been lurking here for quite a while but only now have something to post.

I have been trying to launch a server monitoring business for about 8 months now. Originally I would upgrade copies of WordPress until last month I had a brainwave, despite bigger competitors such as Server Density, I launched [Server Captain][1] in just 5 weeks.

I&#39;d like to get your feedback on the whole idea &amp; the execution. Would this be something you would pay for in general? Would you pay me to do it? If not, how could I convince you of my qualifications? I have been live for about a week now and have had 2 sign ups, one was &quot;test@test.com&quot; and another used mailinator. I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m doing wrong and could really do with being put on the right track.

Cheers,
Adam

            <p>I’d suggest checking out what Dan Norris has done with his company <a href="http://wpcurve.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">WPCurve</a> .  They are doing something similar for WordPress, and his website does a good job of explaining their offering.</p>

            <p>Yes a monthly report is definitely something I am looking at doing, in fact that’s probably the best way to get users in the top of the funnel. I am also thinking of making a hybrid site between what I have now and a long-form sales page such as <a href="http://letsworkshop.com" rel="nofollow noopener">letsworkshop.com</a>. This is all good feedback and I appreciate it all.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>

            <p>Absolutely. You should mention real people - engineers, getting up at 3am, I think it’s in there but I didn’t read the whole page thoroughly. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Have you got any testimonials? Could you provide a report every month for clients (this would be a good thing to do anyway to remind them that you’ve got their back)? Then you can show the demo report to users. Even better a small dashboard where users can see their servers and a log of things that you’ve done would be good marketing.</p>

            <p>It’s difficult to provide a demo as it’s not a SaaS product, it’s all centred around myself providing a service for you. If your server goes down at 3am I am waking up to go fix the issue for you. As you can appreciate because of this it is also basically impossible for me to provide a free trial.</p>
<p>I think I’m relying a little too much on people knowing what managed hosting is, so I need to be clearer with the next iteration of my marketing site.</p>
<p>Cheers all.,<br>

            <p>Your copy was clear enough for me.  I think your larger problem is outreach.  You need to get your service idea in front of lots and lots of people.</p>
<p>Like <a class="mention" href="/u/bradt">@bradt</a> - I just handle this myself.  I know I shouldn’t and that it’s not being done as well as it should.  If it started consuming a lot of my time I’d probably seek out a service like yours.  But right now it’s just a low-level risk so it’s not something for which I’m actively trying to find a solution.  If someone approached me and offered me something compelling at a reasonable price point, I’d probably try it.  But I’m not seeking it out.  So you’ll have to come find me.</p>
<p>(I don’t use Digital Ocean, but I’m sure you can find people who do.)</p>

            <p>I manage my own Linode server and run a <code>yum update</code> once a month or so and just hope that I don’t get hacked. Ideally if I could subscribe to a service that would monitor packages I have installed for security updates, keep an eye on my firewall, monitor logs, and offer other pro-active security measures on my server, I’d be happy to pay for that piece of mind. I have no idea if there are many others out there like me though.</p>
<p>Have you seen <a href="https://serverpilot.io" rel="nofollow noopener">https://serverpilot.io</a> ? These guys look pretty slick and I believe they’re venture-backed.</p>

<p>It sounds like you need to grow that list a bit. Perhaps try to provide some useful content around what you’re providing, perhaps in the form of blog posts or downloadable PDF cheat sheets.</p>

</aside>
<p>The copywriting just isn’t very clear though. It doesn’t say to me: we monitor your servers and then…do something? I tell what you might do when a server fails. Do you notify me? Do you fix it? What happens?</p>
<p>Also, you probably should focus on one thing (say the monitoring) and remove copy around security audits and server management tasks.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple formula for your copywriting: pain - dream - fix.</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the pain.</li>
<li>Describe the dream of how it could be.</li>
<li>Then tell them how your service provides the dream.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

<p>You need to make clear what you are selling, what value you offer. Don’t assume people will know everything. Who is your target market? How much do they know already?</p>

            <p>Adam,</p>
<p>Two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>What channels are you using to spread the word about your service? Do you have a clear goal and plan for acquiring customers?</li>
<li>It’s not clear to me from your site what pain you’re trying to cure. All I see is you are charging $70 per DO droplet (I think) whereas I can get a Droplet directly from DO starting a $5 per month. Can you adjust your site so it clarifies the value you’re offering?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
