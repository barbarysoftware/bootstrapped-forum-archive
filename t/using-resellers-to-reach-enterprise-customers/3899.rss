    <title>Using Resellers to reach Enterprise customers</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/using-resellers-to-reach-enterprise-customers/3899</link>
    <description>I was wondering if anybody has tried working with Resellers (like ComponentSource) to reach more customers in the Enterprise, and think if it&#39;s worth the effort/cost. 
My goal is to reach a wider audience with [SqlSmash](http://www.sqlsmash.com), which is a product targeted at developers. 
I see successful companies like JetBrains and RedGate have many Resellers listed on their website, just not sure if it&#39;s an effective channel.</description>

            <p>I don’t list my product with resellers - rather the way it works for me is that when an enterprise customer wants to purchase through a reseller, they tell the reseller who then gets in touch with me. I’ve never had a customer say “you aren’t listed with reseller xyz - I can’t buy your software” (although perhaps they just don’t tell me!).</p>
<p>They always generate more work and always ask for a discount for the privilege, so my view of them is somewhat coloured.</p>
<p>Having said that, if you have reasonably popular boxed software, it does seem like a good way to attract a few more eye balls.</p>
