    <title>Create videos with tons of friends</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/create-videos-with-tons-of-friends/7425</link>
    <description>Hey y&#39;all! Currently working on a project called ZigZag, which is an ios app. 

On the app, users can co-create videos with as many friends as they like. Once videos go live on the feed, all of the likes &amp; comments are attributed to all contributors - so everyone is rewarded for creating &quot;viral content&quot;.

Would love for y&#39;all to check it out &amp; feedback us! You can find it by searching &quot;ZigZag video&quot; in the App Store. 

Thanks!</description>
