    <title>HI, I&#39;m Josh from zistle.com</title>

    <description>Hi all,

I&#39;m happy to have just found about about this place via Reddit.

I have been working with my wife on [zistle.com][1] for the past few years.  It started out as a small tool to organize my old baseball cards but then grew pretty quickly into a crowdsourced collectibles database.  We have only recently decided to try and turn this into our full-time gig and as such are releasing an e-commerce piece.

Looking forward to the conversations on this board. 

Wish us luck!
