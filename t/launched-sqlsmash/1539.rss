    <description>My 1st product [SqlSmash][1] had been in alpha/beta for the last 2 months with a very bare-bones website. This week, I have officially come out of beta, pushed a new website and started collecting payments.

            <p>Sadly, I did not have a very thought out process for either of those.<br>
I had been developing the tool over the last year and showing it at conferences and user groups where I presented. The tool is targeted at developers, and my network is full of them, so I would show it to them regularly too. Also, there were similar tools already in the market that were doing well and I thought I could do a better job than some of them.</p>
<p>I built an email list during alpha/beta releases. Some traffic trickled from my blog, and some came from Reddit/HN.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the clarification! I would add the “all non major updates” thing to the pricing page otherwise people will expect free updates forever <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<p>Regarding SSMS 2012: I know this but I’m somewhat hesistant to install unnecessary updates on my live server. Currently I don’t do much SQL development so I’m good for now <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/danielherken">@danielherken</a> Thanks for the detailed and honest feedback! All of the points you mentioned are valid and I’ll fix these over the next few days. I plan on redoing the screencast as well, since this was created for the alpha. My todo list is a mile long, but I really wanted to start collecting payments for users who want to pay. So I covered as much stuff as I could during this first update to the website.</p>
<p>All updates will be free for the next year or so until the next major version update. The personal license is locked to a person, so you could buy either (unless you are planning to fire yourself from your company <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> ).</p>
<p>Fyi, you can use SSMS 2012 to connect to older versions of Sql Server (all the way back to 2005 I believe).</p>

            <p><strong>Firstof: Congratulations on Launching!</strong> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>A few thoughts on the website and product itself:</p>
<p><strong>The Product</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Man this is great! Unfortunately I’m still stuck at Management Studio 2010 but I already saved your Plugin because it seems really great functionality wise. I think the best thing is “Format” and the quick search. Nicely done!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Website</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I would suggest shorting the headline to something that is more easy to understand. 3 Lines feels a bit long to me…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe recreate the video part with the function you renamed? This seems a little bit unprofessional, otherwise the video was easy to understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May I ask why the download is a zip file containing an (already compressed) msi file?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feature list with screenshots is a little boring (sorry). Maybe you could spice this up a little?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correct me if I’m wrong but on your pricing page the money guarantee is spelled wrong? It could stand out more in my opinion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is your email address not clickable? You will get a lot of SPAM anyway so you might as well ease the use for the website visitors <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m a little confuses by the licensing. I’m working (alone) at my company so do I have to purchase a commercial version? What does premium support mean? Is there any difference in features? Will I get updates for free? How long?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I like the company name “Smashing Jedis” <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Where are you located? Maybe add an address / imprint to the footer of the page?</p>
