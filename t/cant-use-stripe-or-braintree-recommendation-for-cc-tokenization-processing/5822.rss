    <title>Can&#39;t use stripe or braintree. Recommendation for CC tokenization &amp; processing?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/cant-use-stripe-or-braintree-recommendation-for-cc-tokenization-processing/5822</link>
    <description>My business is not in Stripe&#39;s list of supported countries, and I don&#39;t want to deal with Paypal due to the high probability that my funds and payment processing will be frozen without recourse at some point.

I understand that creating a Stripe Atlas business for payment processing is an option, but their &quot;prohibited activities&quot; list makes it sound like the business&#39; sole activity shouldn&#39;t be payment processing for another party (and hence there&#39;s a strong risk of getting cut off).

Can anyone recommend a good CC tokenizer + payment processer with low drama and fees that&#39;s open to dealing with British territories?</description>

            <p>We use <a href="https://paddle.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Paddle</a>, and are quite satisfied with them.<br>
Considering you’re asking only for a payment processor, they might be a bit too much — they provide a complete package to sell softwares: checkout, mailing list, license generation, pricing, even an SDK, etc. Though we mostly use them for the JS checkout only.<br>
I don’t know about British territories, but they’re UK, so might help.</p>
