    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Dave from AWPCP and Business Directory Plugin</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-dave-from-awpcp-and-business-directory-plugin/966</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,

My name is Dave and I&#39;m the owner of two WordPress plugins (http://awpcp.com and http://businessdirectoryplugin.com), an eBook (http://howtobuyawebsite.org), and working on a new SaaS business (to be announced at MicroConf 2014 :)).

I live in Denver, CO with my wife and 3 kids.  They&#39;re my reason for becoming a bootstrapper so I can live the lifestyle I want without bosses, commutes, bureaucracy or HR.  I still do software consulting, but my goal is to phase that out once business #3 kicks in.

I&#39;ve been a bootstrapper for about 4 and half years since joining the Micropreneur Academy back in the day.  This forum looks like my kind of people to hang out with.  :smile: Looking forward to the discussions, learning and contributing!

-Dave
