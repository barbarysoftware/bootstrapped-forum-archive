    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Matt, I&#39;ve recently started working full time on my side project</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-matt-ive-recently-started-working-full-time-on-my-side-project/3717</link>
    <description>Hi all,

I&#39;m really excited to have discovered bootstrappers.fm, can&#39;t believe I hadn&#39;t seen it sooner. 

Anyway, a little over 4 years ago I started my side project BugMuncher (www.bugmuncher.com) an SaaS website feedback tool, while working full time as a freelance Rails developer.

In September of this year, I decided to fire all my freelance clients, and start working full time on BugMuncher. 

I&#39;ve been completely transparently documenting my progress in a series of blog posts, as a new user I can&#39;t post the link yet, but if you&#39;re interested, look for Part 1 on blog.bugmuncher.com. Writing the blog posts has been really helpful, it&#39;s forced me to really examine all the numbers, and I&#39;ve had an amazingly positive response.

That&#39;s all from me for now, looking forward to participating a lot here in 2016!

Cheers,
Matt</description>

<p>The headline on your landing page isnt really clear. I had to go into features to see what the product did.</p>
<p>You need a stronger headline that clearly identifies what you do. Maybe put a few gif videos right on the main page, so users can see the benefits right away, without having to click around.</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback, I’ve really struggled with the headline, and have tried a bunch of different things. I did wonder if the current one was too ambiguous, I’ll try to come up with something new <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slightly_smiling.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling:"></p>
<p>I did have an animated explainer video, but I made a mini pivot that meant the video wasn’t really on the right message any more, need to sort out another one.</p>
