    <title>Created a secondary service MobileMyForm off our main service PushForms</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/created-a-secondary-service-mobilemyform-off-our-main-service-pushforms/2774</link>
    <description>We have a software service called PushForms http://getpushforms.com and have created a secondary service based on feedback received.  Some people don&#39;t want to create their own forms and and want a full service hand holding experience.

Here is the new service.  MobileMyForm http://www.mobilemyform.com - Turns your paper forms into a native mobile app. Just send us a copy of your form or describe the data you need collected, you can add additional fields like photos, barcode scanning, GPS location to your forms unlike paper. Within 3 days your App will be completed.

Has anyone had success with this type of approach?</description>

            <p>The services area is very interesting but only concern is that consulting is not a scalable business. I do like the idea of very niche level integrations.  Thanks for the idea.</p>

            <p>I thought I’d also ask if you have thought about a services arm to the business? For instance, custom queries/reports of the data could be done for an flat rate cost. System integrations, validation, etc… all sorts of services I could think of that might be quite a bit of revenue given the right clients.</p>

            <p>I’ve seen companies do this in K-12 very successfully (e.g. eliminate all paper forms for parents upon signing up for school each year). Coupled with solid integrations into SISes/LMSes, they are in the seven to eight figure revenue range. I know this because I did the integration pieces for them (e.g. Infinite Campus, Canvas, BrainHoney).</p>
<p>Even without that angle, it might not be the sexiest problem to solve in the world by any means but I have no doubt it could be quite the cash cow. Imagine how many small businesses there are that would happily hand over $99/year for this. The hurdle, IMO, would be making such people aware of it.</p>
