    <title>#142: Revisiting our pre-pandemic yearly goals</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/142-revisiting-our-pre-pandemic-yearly-goals/7008</link>
    <description>@freyfogle and I revisit the goals we made in January 2020. We consider what progress we’ve made despite the current massive global uncertainty.

Back in January, in episode #124, [Ed and Steve stated their goals for 2020](https://bootstrapped.fm/124-goals-for-2020/). Then COVID-19 happened, changing many of the assumptions we had when we made those goals.
