    <title>What is the motivation for your business?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/what-is-the-motivation-for-your-business/1567</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been struggling with coming up a clear vision of why I like building the business I&#39;m building. I love the strategy/building process of it but I&#39;m fuzzy on the why.
 
I was curious to hear why do you do bootstrap, why do you work, what is your goal/vision for your business?

            <p>My motivation was pretty straightforward as a developer in his 40s:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a stream of income that I control 100% (can’t be laid off, or the project terminated because of random management reasoning, the curse of consulting!)</li>
<li>Get complete control over my time and life (work when I want, take time off when I want)</li>
<li>Generate income that allows me to be location-independent</li>
<li>Stop trading hours for dollars</li>
</ol>
<p>Like <a class="mention" href="/u/ian">@ian</a>, I’m a practical guy so I’m not swinging for the fences either.  I’m looking for full consulting income replacement and then I’ll figure it out from there.  The business is taking on a life of its own as I build it, which is great–there’s always something new to learn or work on, so I don’t get bored.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’ve worked as an employee of a web agency (1 yr), as a freelancer (4 yrs), and as a developer at a venture-backed startup (2 yrs). Having had those experiences, I’ve decided to bootstrap moving forward for a few key reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>To have the most freedom to try out &amp; measure new ideas</li>
<li>To have the most freedom in how I structure my day</li>
<li>To build things that I’m proud of</li>
<li>To build things that secure my future income, not someone else’s (with the exception of customers)</li>
<li>To not have to compromise to please a misguided client, board member, or employer</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s definitely not the money, as I made a respectable income in every other type of employment; It’s the freedom to put into practice what I read about and discuss with others, as well as the ability to engineer my lifestyle.</p>

            <p>I’m with <a class="mention" href="/u/ian">@ian</a> I’m far too focussed on ‘superior’ execution, due to my ‘developer nature’.</p>
<p>I’m not shooting for the moon, I’m trying to create stuff I want to see in the world and make a good salary doing it!</p>

            <p>So, my initial motivation was primarily:</p>
<ol>
<li>Formalizing my creative outlet</li>
<li>Replace my day job</li>
</ol>
<p>I never really considered the idea we’d grow big enough to have employees and such, if I was able to replace my salary that was enough.</p>
<p>I really wanted to optimize for success (meaning stay in business) so I never really viewed it very realistically in terms of changing an industry (though maybe we were a bit of a precursor of changes that were coming). That’s something that I do think about a bit more these days perhaps, my problem though is that my ideas tend to be very practical and practical ideas usually aren’t the type that disrupt industries.</p>

            <p>I started out with money in mind but I feel like that motivation doesn’t stay for very long personally and isn’t fulfilling in the ‘spiritual’ sense.</p>
<p>Currently leaning towards the cause and effect my business will have in our industry if we keep pushing forward.</p>
<p>Would love to hear want <a class="mention" href="/u/ian">@ian</a> has to say about this. He’s been with his company for 9-10 years?</p>

</aside>
<p>Lol. Yes sir, it’s clear enough.</p>
<p>It’s not politically correct to say so, but my motivation is money. I don’t want to be stinkin’ rich, just have enough so I no longer need to work for Da Man.</p>
<p>The only *Terms and condition is: I need to be able to sleep peacefully at night. So nothing sleazy or manipulative, nothing growth hacker-y, no tricks or short cuts that sound dishonest.</p>

<p>I’m doing it because I was broke and if I won’t rebuild my wealth before I’m not able to work anymore I will be placed into some senior’s house where I will slowly rot until I die.</p>
