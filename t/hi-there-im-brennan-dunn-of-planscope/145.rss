    <title>Hi there, I&#39;m Brennan Dunn of Planscope</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-there-im-brennan-dunn-of-planscope/145</link>
    <description>My name is Brennan Dunn, and I&#39;m the founder of [Planscope][1], a project management app for freelancers and teams of consultants.

I also work on...

 - [Freelancer&#39;s Weekly][2], my newsletter with 6.5k+ subscribers (essentially my primary customer acquisition channel for everything I do.)
 - Author of [&quot;Double Your Freelancing Rate&quot;][3] and [&quot;Sell Yourself Online: The Blueprint&quot;][4]
 - I teach a [monthly workshop][5] on consulting (and do occasional [one-off workshops][6])
 - I host [The Business of Freelancing][7] podcast

The newsletter, books, and podcast have worked amazingly well to bring in new Planscope customers (&gt; 60% of new subscribers come from one of the above), and I&#39;ve also had a lot of luck ranking for freelance-specific keywords.

I&#39;m working on some more team-focused reporting features right now, as $199/mo &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; $24/mo :smile: (plus, freelancers tend to have a *very hard time* staying in business, and the first thing they do when work dries up is cancel things like Planscope.)

Cheers,
Brennan

            <p>Hey Brennan.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the outside, I’m really impressed with Planscope both as an app and as a business.  There are only a handful of apps that cause me to think “wow, that’s great, I wish I’d built that!” and Planscope is one of them.</p>
<p>That said, I intend to shameless ape your marketing methods to help me get SmallSpec rolling!  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
