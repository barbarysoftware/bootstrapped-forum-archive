    <title>Payment / subscription billing options for SaaS</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/payment-subscription-billing-options-for-saas/1309</link>
    <description>Hi everyone!

This is my first post here, my name is Niko and I&#39;m not *exactly* a bootstrapper: I run tech and product at a small company of 10 (www.eyequant.com). We&#39;re a frugal bunch though, and I&#39;ve always found the bootstrapper&#39;s perspective very helpful and applicable to us.

With that out of that way, my question that I&#39;d like to discuss is: who to choose for SaaS payments and/or subscription billing.

We&#39;re currently with a terrible provider (charges too much, is technically… well, less than ideal, and only settles every *other* month). We&#39;re finally ready to replace them, so I&#39;ve started looking at the options (Stripe/Braintree/Paymill and a long list of others), but I&#39;m not sure who&#39;s best for our situation.

I&#39;ve found 2 [existing](http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/looking-at-recurly-and-other-subscription-billing-options/376) [threads](http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/changing-payment-suppliers/137), but I was wondering: do you have any more love stories / war stories to share on specific providers?

Thanks!
Niko

PS: Here&#39;s a list of constraints / wishes I made for myself, but maybe it gives you a better picture of our situation. Sorry if this is TMI! :smile:

- we&#39;d prefer a hybrid provider that does subscription billing and works as a payment gateway, but I&#39;m open to combos like Recurly+Braintree too
- we are based in Germany, so providers should produce EU-acceptable invoices, handle VAT deductions and should be US-EU Safe Harbor certified
- we exclusively sell to businesses
- we mainly sell SaaS subscriptions, but also have pay-as-you-go packages: both standalone and on top of subscriptions
- billing cycles are varied: we do monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual bookings, and the odd custom case
- we have some legacy customers on contracts which we don&#39;t offer to new customers
- we have customers in Europe, North America, the UK, SE Asia, and Australia
- we sometimes give leads discounts (probs best implemented as voucher codes)
- we accept VISA/MC/AMEX
- we accept payments in USD/EUR/GBP
- nice to have: taking German ELV and/or EU SEPA direct debit
- provider should settle at least monthly
- should offer emailing billing receipts
- should include self-serve basics like allowing customers to update their credit card details and sending automated expiry reminders to customers
- should support a billing email address that&#39;s different from the account&#39;s primary address
- should be able to create subscriptions with manual invoicing / payment
- nice to have: allow customers to up- or downgrade to a different plan in the middle of a month and calculate pro-rata charges
- nice to have: allow pausing subscriptions, with self-serve ability to re-activate without entering payment data again</description>

            <p>I run a SaaS in EU and I went with Stripe. I’m planning to add Quaderno as soon as I need it.</p>
<p>I would probably have chosen Recurly + Stripe, but… then I wouldn’t have been able to use  <a href="http://www.firstofficer.io" rel="nofollow noopener">FirstOfficer</a> myself, and that’s an impossibility for me. If you use Stripe API through a 3rd part API, you are losing the opportunity to use many of the <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/integrations" rel="nofollow noopener">fab tools built on top of Stripe</a>.</p>
<p>I think what sets Stripe apart from the other solutions is the rich ecosystem that has developed around it. If you need something, be it dunning, invoicing or analytics, there’s an app for it. In many cases, there are several apps to choose from. I see this as a huge step forward from having to pick a one provider for everything.</p>

            <p>Yes, you can charge as many different prices as you want.</p>
<p>Let’s say you have a Basic plan of $10 on your app and your VAT rate is 20% (when applicable). On Stripe you’ll create 2 different plans: Basic Non-VAT of $10 and Basic VAT of $12.</p>
<p>Then, when you create a new Stripe subscription on your app, you’ll select one of those plans depending on whether or not VAT needs to be included. You can even <a href="http://quaderno.io/#lang-ruby" rel="nofollow noopener">set the VAT rate you want to apply</a>, via subscription’s metadata. And Quaderno will make the rest.</p>
<p>Can this help you? Please let me know if you have any other question. Happy to help.</p>

            <p>Quardano looks interesting but it looks like a reverse charging solution. Am I right? So everyone would pay the same price for my service but depending on their location etc I would allocate some of it to VAT, or not. Is this correct? Do you have any thoughts as to how this approach compares to deciding at the time of payment whether the customer needs to pay VAT or not - so actually charging a different price depending on whether or not VAT needs to be included?</p>

            <p>In my opinion, Stripe and Braintree are both very good payment gateways. I’ve used both and they’re very easy to integrate in a SaaS, specially Stripe.</p>
<p>To deal with invoices, VAT, and so on… a few weeks ago we launched <a href="http://quaderno.io" rel="nofollow noopener">Quaderno.io</a>, an invoicing application for Stripe. Every time you make a charge on Stripe, <a href="http://Quaderno.io" rel="nofollow noopener">Quaderno.io</a> automatically creates and sends an invoice to your customer. That’s all! No code. No pain.</p>
<p>We’re based in the EU, so we know how messy VAT is <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> No problem.<br>
We detect your customer is in an EU country and we handle VAT deductions.</p>
<p>Quaderno also allows you to manage pay-as-you-go packages, customize your invoices, or make subscriptions with manual invoicing / payment to have all your invoices (from Stripe or manually entered) in the same application.</p>
<p>I’d love to hear your feedback.</p>

</aside>
<p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/thibaut_barrere">@thibaut_barrere</a>! I don’t think Recurly offered Stripe when we looked into it almost a year ago but it would probably be my preferred combination now.</p>
<p>One annoying thing about Recurly: they bundle a free gateway for U.S. customers but don’t give a reduced price if you use your own gateway (which EU customer have to and you’re likely paying for). I know it’s trivial and a bit irrational, but it just feels like I’m being ripped off a bit. <strong>Sidenote</strong>: be careful when giving free things as they can occasionally make your product less attractive</p>

            <p>Thibaut, thanks so much for this super-detailed response! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> Glad to see proof that it’s POSSIBLE to have a payments setup that makes you happy!</p>
<p>I have a much better (but still far from good enough) understanding of all the different pieces we’ll need: payment gateway, subscription management, invoice generation, payment reminders, retries, reporting, etc.</p>
<p>Recurly looks like it does much of the heavy lifting for a few of these functions, but one thing I haven’t figured out yet is whether it’s possible to register customers in their system who <em>don’t</em> pay by card (either manual invoicing or direct debit). We’re perfectly happy taking those payments offline, but it’d be great if Recurly could also function as the dashboard where <strong>all</strong> our subscribers are listed, not just those who pay by card. Is that maybe an enterprise feature in Recurly that I can’t see in my trial account?</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help, this is invaluable info!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>For me, using <strong>Recurly with Stripe</strong> (Recurly for the subscriptions, Stripe as the gateway) is a perfect combo for EU-based SaaS selling internationally (this is what I use for <a href="https://www.wisecashhq.com" rel="nofollow noopener">WiseCash</a> - and also for freelancing projects).</p>
<p>Stripe provides a no-paperwork (only ID scanned via the browser, pretty neat!) gateway with a modern API (unlike WireCard), while Recurly provides a feature-rich (VAT handling, PCI SAQ A with Recurly.js, integrated dunning, all kinds of subscription goodies).</p>
<p>Note that I also investigated Stripe alone, but like it has been pointed out, the VAT implementation alone will be a big PITA (quoting people who did it - and I also did some research).</p>
<p>And goodies: I have open-sourced a <a href="https://github.com/thbar/rails-recurly-js-sample-application" rel="nofollow noopener">Rails sample app to help out</a>, with a <a href="https://www.wisecashhq.com/blog" rel="nofollow noopener">series of articles</a> (a third one is upcoming soon).</p>
<p>See below where I address each of your points.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we’d prefer a hybrid provider that does subscription billing and works as a payment gateway, but I’m open to combos like Recurly+Braintree too</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d recommend Recurly+Stripe (easiest path).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we are based in Germany, so providers should produce EU-acceptable invoices, handle VAT deductions and should be US-EU Safe Harbor certified</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recurly is Safe Harbor compliant (<a href="https://recurly.com/legal/privacy/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://recurly.com/legal/privacy/</a>), will handle VAT (with country auto-selection, and VIES validation to remove the VAT when applicable).</p>
<p>You can customize the email generated for invoices (not sure about PDF).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we exclusively sell to businesses</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we mainly sell SaaS subscriptions, but also have pay-as-you-go packages: both standalone and on top of subscriptions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can handle one-off purchases, multiple subscriptions by customer (I believe) etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>billing cycles are varied: we do monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual bookings, and the odd custom case</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all supported (I use monthly + yearly).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we have some legacy customers on contracts which we don’t offer to new customers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can display only the currently offered plans, and “sign” the plan code to avoid tampering by the end user (afaik).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we have customers in Europe, North America, the UK, SE Asia, and Australia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have customers all over the world, no problem so far <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>we sometimes give leads discounts (probs best implemented as voucher codes)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is coupon code support (you can limit number of use, redemption limit date, percentage or price discount etc). I used this extensively at some point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we accept VISA/MC/AMEX</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same, no problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we accept payments in USD/EUR/GBP</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will have to go “enterprise” plan, this is more expensive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nice to have: taking German ELV and/or EU SEPA direct debit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t think this is supported.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>provider should settle at least monthly</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stripe send me the sum of today charges in 7 days. I get money sent every day <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Beware that Stripe will (for now) apply a 2% conversion fee if you charge in USD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>should offer emailing billing receipts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>should include self-serve basics like allowing customers to update their credit card details and sending automated expiry reminders to customers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can generate a billing update form quite easily (integrated in my app).</p>
<p>I send the reminders myself, but automatic reminders are now supported.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>should support a billing email address that’s different from the account’s primary address</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The account is identified by a GUID (for me, to remove adherence from the email address).</p>
<p>There is a billing contact info, which can be different.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>should be able to create subscriptions with manual invoicing / payment</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Supported but in “enterprise” pricing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nice to have: allow customers to up- or downgrade to a different plan in the middle of a month and calculate pro-rata charges</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Definitely works. I even implemented (for a freelancing client) instant upgrades, but delayed downgrades at end of billing cycle, using web-hooks. Works well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nice to have: allow pausing subscriptions, with self-serve ability to re-activate without entering payment data again</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The billing information is kept on file; I think you can find a way to do that, but not sure exactly how.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>– Thibaut</p>

            <p>Haha, we have our share of manually invoiced customers that pay by bank transfer, too. Why anyone would prefer that over credit card payments is lost on me, but a happy customer is a good customer. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<p>Sounds like quite the pain with Stripe. The more I look at it, Stripe seems not quite up to the task. I mean, they don’t even an address field on customer records!</p>
<p>Braintree+Recurly is more looking like an option that might be viable, and Paymill is indeed an alternative I’m eyeing closely, but their invoicing offering isn’t too inspiring either.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure that there’s any one service that does all that.</p>
<p>I’ve previously looked at Recurly, CheddarGetter, Saasy, Charify and PayMill in the past. PayMill might actually be a good solution because they’re based in Germany — though they’re blatantly “inspired” by Stripe. I like Stripe but you do need to build a bit of infrastructure to support it. For example, with VAT you need to <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/metered-subscription-billing" rel="nofollow noopener">implement a webhook that adds VAT to each subscription invoice</a> as it’s generated (probably by first checking if your customer needs to pay VAT, which is an art in itself).</p>
<p>We went with Recurly+Braintree and the paperwork was kinda annoying and took about 2-3 weeks. Oddly, since then we’ve never actually used Recurly and all our payments have been through cheques or bank transfers (enterprise sales, huh!)</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/dgrigg">@dgrigg</a> Thanks! One thing I can’t really tell with Stripe is whether we’d have to build the interface for upgrading/downgrading, changing card details, cancelling, downloading invoices, etc. ourselves. I would prefer to outsource that to someone who has that as their core competency, but that may be asking too much.</p>

            <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>This is my first post here, my name is Niko and I’m not <em>exactly</em> a bootstrapper: I run tech and product at a small company of 10 (<a href="http://www.eyequant.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.eyequant.com</a>). We’re a frugal bunch though, and I’ve always found the bootstrapper’s perspective very helpful and applicable to us.</p>
<p>With that out of that way, my question that I’d like to discuss is: who to choose for SaaS payments and/or subscription billing.</p>
<p>We’re currently with a terrible provider (charges too much, is technically… well, less than ideal, and only settles every <em>other</em> month). We’re finally ready to replace them, so I’ve started looking at the options (Stripe/Braintree/Paymill and a long list of others), but I’m not sure who’s best for our situation.</p>
<p>I’ve found 2 <a href="http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/looking-at-recurly-and-other-subscription-billing-options/376">existing</a> <a href="http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/changing-payment-suppliers/137">threads</a>, but I was wondering: do you have any more love stories / war stories to share on specific providers?</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>
Niko</p>
<p>PS: Here’s a list of constraints / wishes I made for myself, but maybe it gives you a better picture of our situation. Sorry if this is TMI! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
