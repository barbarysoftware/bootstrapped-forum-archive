    <title>What&#39;s the most efficient digital product you know from a business model point of view? (i.e. WinRar)</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/whats-the-most-efficient-digital-product-you-know-from-a-business-model-point-of-view-i-e-winrar/2097</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to make a list of products that generate a good amount of money compared:

1. The simplicity of its design.
2. The costs to develop and maintain them

For example: 

- [WinRar][1]
- [Hello Bar][2]
- [Yotpo][3]
- [I Done This][4]
- [Place it][5]
- [Toggle - Insanely Simple Time Tracking][6]
- [Delighted - Gathering Feedback Faster][7] 
- [Selz - Simple Way to Sell Online][8] 

I will be editing the list with everybody suggestions.

            <p>Yep, totally agree. Even apparently simpler projects can hide high complexity.</p>
<p>What I’m looking for though, is those products that while using simple technology, offer a high enough amount of value for people to pay for them.</p>
<p>Customers don’t care about how difficult it is to create the solution, and often, I find myself and other product builders forget that.</p>

            <p>We didn’t launch it, but yes a good learning exercise and we got to re-use a lot of things later on. I’m trying to make a point the simple products often encapsulate a lot of complexity. The skill and time comes from making that complexity simple to users. If you can do that - then you have a successful product.</p>

            <p>Two weeks seem a reasonable cost IMO <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>The products I’m looking for are ones that, with the simplest technology and interface possible, are still valuable enough to generate money.</p>

            <p>Interesting assumptions, Place It is significantly harder then it seems. Did something similar in 2012 that never saw the light of day after 1 or 2 weeks of full time work on it.</p>
