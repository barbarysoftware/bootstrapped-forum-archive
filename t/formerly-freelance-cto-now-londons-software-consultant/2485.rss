    <title>Formerly Freelance CTO, now London&#39;s Software Consultant</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/formerly-freelance-cto-now-londons-software-consultant/2485</link>
    <description>Hi all,
James is my name, I&#39;ve done a couple of startups (one still going) and am currently moving into the consulting side of things.

On leaving my last startup at first I was a Ruby freelancer, then realised I was also providing the CTO services so switched over to Freelance CTO.

Since I ended up having to explain what a freelance CTO does I&#39;ve realised that a CTO is simply a Software consultant who is full time (plus a few extra&#39;s) I&#39;ve decided to market myself as London&#39;s Software Consultant.

I&#39;m finding a lot of challenges in the sales side of the business (specifically, how to find customers when you don&#39;t have a network and how to close).

James.</description>

            <p>Cheers, startups consume your life, currently I don’t have a worthwhile idea so consulting is a happy alternative (work on other peoples interesting problems).</p>

            <p>Hey, interesting approach you’re taking there. M’afraid the only way you’re going to build that network is to get out there and pimp your services.</p>
<p>I take it you enjoy the consulting side of things and so you’re getting back in to that game by choice?</p>
<p>Either way good luck with it.</p>
