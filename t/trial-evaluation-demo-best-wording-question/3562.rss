    <title>Trial, evaluation, demo? Best wording question</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/trial-evaluation-demo-best-wording-question/3562</link>
    <description>What is the best wording to call an evaluation version of the software? I&#39;m not a native English speaker.

* Trial - sounds a bit outdated to me but I currently use this one mostly
* Demo - some people may consider it that someone will guide them with using a demo, or that the version is crippled a lot?
* Evaluation - this sounds the best (at least to me)

Bonus question, if a desktop software run time is limited, how to call the countdown timer? Currently it using the following format: &quot;Trial HH:MM:SS&quot; - would it be better to use Eval or Demo instead?</description>

            <p>While preparing a new major release, I discovered that nag screen wasn’t updated for years (8 years or so), that’s why I though maybe wording I used back then needs to be changed.</p>

            <p>I think you’re putting way too much emphasis on a small point. Pick one, and move forward.</p>
<p>Your English sounds pretty good to me, trust your gut.</p>
<p>Countdown timer looks fine too.</p>
<p>If you have a super successful business and thousands of people coming to check out your product, then you can split test something like this using optimization software, but that’s way down the line.</p>
