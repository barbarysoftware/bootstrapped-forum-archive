    <title>When and how to hire the first sales person</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/when-and-how-to-hire-the-first-sales-person/3525</link>
    <description>Hi guys,

I&#39;m in the lucky position to have more and more traffic and leads on my product but I&#39;m struggling to close more deals. With the current numbers revenue wise I would be able to hire (at least a part time) sales person. 

Has anybody any experience with this? I&#39;m talking B2B sales only mostly to bigger clients (not necessary) enterprise but still with some of the usual &#39;demo/sales&#39; dance. 

To be more specific the following questions come to mind:
- Where to find a decent sales person?
- How to compensate? Base salary? Commission?
- What &#39;things&#39; should be in place for a sales person to work with?</description>

            <p>Yeah, no idea <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Part time seems like it would be hard but can start by putting out some ads. Maybe authentic jobs, maybe wherever sales people hang out???</p>

            <p>Around the middle of this weeks podcast we talk about this a bit and what we’re doing at UserScape <a href="http://bootstrapped.fm/bootstrapped-episode-58/">http://bootstrapped.fm/bootstrapped-episode-58/</a></p>
<p>Finding a decent part time one is going to be really hard. No advice there <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<p>We do base salary plus commission. We have a large existing customer base so we have 2 commission tiers. X for support renewals and license sales to existing customers 2X for new business to fully new customers or new divisions/departments of existing customers.</p>
<p>We’re using <a href="http://Close.io">Close.io</a> for sales CRM. It’s a little rough in spots, but overall we like it. You need something like that and GoToMeeting or similar. We also use a product called Schedule Once to let people select demo times and it automatically creates a GTM meeting and sends them the info.</p>
