    <title>What kind of tech boards do you visit, if any?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/what-kind-of-tech-boards-do-you-visit-if-any/1095</link>
    <description>I&#39;m curious for those who are techie folks of what sites/boards you visit. I&#39;m asking because I think this board is specifically tailored for bootstrapping methods/techniques and not tech specifically.

Having frequented HN for the past year and a half, /r/startup, /r/dotcom, and /r/entrepreneur, I feel that the quality of HN has completely gone down, with majority of the posts being noise and reposts from reddit. </description>
