    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Lukas (plus an invitation to help you with piracy)</title>

    <description>Hi,

I&#39;m Lukas from Austria, and I develop a specialized 3D animation software, available at http://bit.ly/1nRTJzJ .
Besides that, I&#39;m studying computer science and I&#39;m a juggler.
Looking forward to reading and contributing here!

Being in the Desktop market, piracy is somewhat of a problem for me. Thanks to download sites, it&#39;s quite easy to share a complete pirated version of the product.
I developed my own tools and processes to locate and take down these pirated versions. It works quite well and seems to be more effective than other tools I tried.
This is an in-house tool, and I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll ever turn that into a product, However I&#39;m curious how well it works for other peoples products.
If you have a piracy problem, feel free to contact me. I&#39;ll run a search using my tools and tell you the results. There is no effort for you, and I won&#39;t take any action on your behalf. I won&#39;t charge anything either, as this is just an experiment.

Cheers,
Lukas</description>
