    <title>Feedback on appure.io - ios/android screenshot generator</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/feedback-on-appure-io-ios-android-screenshot-generator/4504</link>
    <description>AHey everyone! 

My name is Oleksii and I have recently updated and launched my second startup [appure.io](https://appure.io)  - tool to help mobile developers / aso optimizators to generate customized, annotated and localized screenshots for both the Play Store and the Apple App Store. Though the product might not target the largest audience, my goal is to implement the best tool professionals in certain areas. 

Would love to hear any feedback on the tool, landing page and your ideas in general. Also would appreciate if you could share the tool with your mobile-developer friend or colleague :smile: 

Thanks!</description>

            <p>Hey Vlad, thanks for your feedback.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is making a screenshot a regular operation, or is it done once per application?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends on a type of user. Indeed, an indie developer most likely won’t be interested in monthly subscription. That is why i have a basic plan for free which covers all basic needs except having &gt; 1 app.</p>
<p>Currently i’m trying to target <a href="http://appure.io" rel="nofollow noopener">appure.io</a> as a tool for small agencies and aso specialists, who generate lots of screenshots for a/b tests and so ( i have couple such customers who do that on 2-3 days basis ).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then monthly charges are tolerable (in fact, too small), but I’m hitting a limit of 10 applications pretty fast.<br>
Correct, but so far i didn’t have any customer who went beyond this limit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m also working on enterprise plan that would have unlimited apps and useful features like api and itunes/play store uploads.</p>
<p>But I will definitely consider your suggestion about pay per app model. Thanks <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> !</p>

<p>I’m not a mobile developer, but I wonder – is making a screenshot a regular operation, or is it done once per application?</p>
<p>If it is once, then the pricing for the middle tier is off, I believe:</p>
<p>Suppose I’m one guy and have say 3 applications. I do screenshots once and I’m not interested in monthly charges. You are interested in them, I do understand, but I’m not.</p>
<p>Or suppose I’m a small agency or freelancer, and make apps on a conveyor. Then monthly charges are tolerable (in fact, too small), but I’m hitting a limit of 10 applications pretty fast.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is that the price should be per application, IMHO.</p>
