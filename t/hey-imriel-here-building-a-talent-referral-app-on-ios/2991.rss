    <description>Hey all

I was actually introduced to the site a few months ago by a Content Strategist I know called Hannah, I work at Nudge, soon to be Nudj, fingers crossed! I&#39;m the Head of content and we are working on a Talent Referral App we are still in development but hope to be launching a private beta soon. I hope I can be a useful member of the community :smile:</description>
