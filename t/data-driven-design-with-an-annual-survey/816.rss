    <title>Data-driven design with an Annual Survey</title>

    <description>A really useful post on 24 ways by Aaarron Walter of MailChimp: http://24ways.org/2013/data-driven-design-with-an-annual-survey/

I&#39;ve been thinking about surveying our Perch customers to try and get round the problem that we only hear from about 25% of our customers in support, and I have this nagging feeling that can sometimes skew development of the product towards who shouts the loudest. It would be interesting to see if we can coax some of the happy majority who simply buy licenses quietly into telling us what they think.</description>

            <p>That’s a great article. From a support burden standpoint, the best customers are the ones you never hear from, so it makes sense to engage them to see if there is anything that can improve their experience.</p>
