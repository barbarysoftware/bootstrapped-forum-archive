    <title>How would you monetize a MMO browser based game?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-would-you-monetize-a-mmo-browser-based-game/3905</link>
    <description>I&#39;m in the process of building a game that I have received really good feedback on so I&#39;m going to build it.

Does anyone have experience monetizing a browser based game?

Features mine will have:

* 10 or so guns
* Realtime multiplayer
* Custom drawn levels
* Multiple characters

I was thinking I would allow free players one or two guns and one character.
After you pay $10 or w/e you get access to everything.</description>

<p>That’s “in game purchases” model that seems working very well for most modern games. So I’d say it is a way to go.</p>
<p>I would only not called players “free vs paid”, but “players vs premium players”. Somehow it feels to me that a new joining users would feel a pressure that they have to upgrade to paid to have the full fun from the game if you called them “free”. I believe your retention number could be slightly better if you have “players” and “premium players”. That also confirmed by the games I see my kids are played.</p>
<p>The extra characters/guns should then be significantly better than the normal ones.</p>

            <p>Maybe very very early but they started charging fairly early on.</p>
<p>I asked A LOT of people about this before engaging it’s development and this is the most well received thing I have worked on.  I plan on working on this for a long time.</p>
<p>The only other thing I can think of is runescape.  I plan on making the alpha and beta versions free or at least prepaid at a discount.</p>

<p>Markus "Notch" Persson began developing the game as a project. He was inspired to create Minecraft by several other games such as Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper, and later Infiniminer. At the time, he had visualised an isometric 3D building game that would be a cross between his inspirations and had made some early prototypes. Infiniminer heavily influenced the style of gameplay, including the first-person aspect of the game, the "blocky" visual style and the block-building fundamentals.  Minecra...</p>

            <p>Do you know of anyone who has managed to charge for such a game?</p>
<p>Even Minecraft was free till they got to huge numbers, I THINK.<br>
Seems like a very competitive business.</p>
<p>(Not to rain on your excitement and all. But I think it’s good to be realistic)</p>
