    <title>Is anyone paying for SEO help? How do you find someone who is doing it the right way and getting results?</title>

    <description>This post contains both a very general and very specific question. Let me give some context to frame my inquiry and then ask my questions.

I run three small side projects all of which I want to grow. All three perform poorly in terms of organic inbound traffic.

I have not invested much effort or money into content marketing or other organic-centric strategies. I recognize that starting with the basics of keeping fresh content on the sites, getting a decent backlink portfolio, etc.. would be a good place to start. I&#39;ve done a TON of reading over the years and have worked for some very SEO dependent companies so I *know* all the fundamentals.

Beyond those &quot;evergreen&quot; basics, I recognize that there is also the constant game of trying to stay one step ahead of the of the search engines and use some very specific tactical approaches. I&#39;m not even talking black-hat/gray-hat stuff. I&#39;m just talking about optimizing all of your efforts in the ways that have the most impact currently. For instance, from what I&#39;ve read there is a right way and a bunch of wrong ways to do guest posting these days.

I worked for Mahalo.com during the original Panda update. We were one of many sites that got obliterated by that change and so I experienced first hand how certain tactics can be VERY effective one day and then be completely gone the next day all at the whim of the all-mighty Googs.

I do want to personally get good at the basic evergreen fundamentals of organic inbound marketing but I would also love some consultation and augmentation from really good, really smart people who are focusing on THIS all day everyday. As a web based business founder, I think that it is essential for me to stay aware of the current SEO landscape. On the other hand, I&#39;m also a husband, father and full-time employee so I just simply can&#39;t invest the amount of time it would take to stay sharp as an &quot;SEO Ninja&quot; (you can slap me for that). For that reason I would like to find some really good people to help me with my businesses.

So there&#39;s all of the context.

Now for the questions.

General Question:
How do you handle SEO? Does everyone here run their own SEO/content marketing/inbound marketing? Has anyone successfully found a way to augment your businesses by delegating some of that strategy and execution?

Specific Question:
If you do have SEO help, how did you find it? Who do you recommend?</description>

            <p>I like Ahrefs guides more, they are a bit more advanced and updated more frequently. Also, Ahrefs delivers a better value for $99/mo than Moz or SEMRush (I tried all 3 of them).<br>

            <p>After working on this over 2 months, I realized the sad state of the Internet. I got too comfy in my professional semi-curated bubble but outside the web is basically made of content farms with shallow articles.</p>
<p>Google gives them preference over small useful sites because they’re wordy and frequently updated but it’s all just sophisticated spam that reciting worn out motivational tips and unoriginal lists. Also, there are copies of paid PR pieces disguised as articles. They should be “nofollow”, but of course they are not.</p>
<p>It’s understandable why “side project marketing” is becoming more popular – spammers can’t write cool tools and apps yet. I wonder how fast my content will be copied, rewritten, and posted to these places. Anyway, there’s no other option but to create top quality stuff to stand out in all this noise.</p>
<p>Here’s a great post about this problem, the pie example really hits home:<br>

            <p>Initially we made this decision by looking at <a href="https://macpaw.com" rel="nofollow noopener">MacPaw</a> and <a href="http://flexibits.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Flexibits</a> who are keeping their products on one domain (though MacPaw has a couple of exact product name microsites for their biggest things).</p>
<p>For product name (people like to search “qobserve”, by the way <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=5" title=":sweat_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":sweat_smile:">) it’s always our site on top. For other queries we’ll work on microsites, comparisons, and case studies. Getting a nice not-occupied product name + .com domain + Twitter is quite a task in 2017.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was looking at the renaming options for half a day and remembered why we went with this jabberwocky of a brand. Everything time-related is occupied either by product or some company name, there are hundreds of time trackers on Capterra. Probably the “Newton Mail” way is an option – finding some popular concept and adding a product type to it.</p>

<p>Do you think it’s ok stay on the company’s site that’s not very memorable either?</p>

</aside>
<p>For very small companies, my preference is to build up the product’s brand, rather than the company’s brand. I think it is preferable to have your product on “<a href="http://qbserve.com">qbserve.com</a>” rather than “<a href="http://yourcompany.com/qbserve">yourcompany.com/qbserve</a>”. I don’t think there is much gain in building up the company brand (or “domain authority”) at this stage. Do that in the future, when you have multiple products and it is more important. I’m afraid I don’t have a strong argument for this view. It is about staying focused on the actions that will give you the biggest short-term to medium-term gain.</p>

<p>That is when SEMRush last updated its data. Google has moved away from really big updates every few months to daily updates. IIRC they are pushing more than 100 changes to the algorithm every day.</p>

            <p>Many thanks again! I really (really!) appreciate everyone’s help. For me it’s this moment when I’m starting to move in a new direction and I don’t know what I don’t know, so making decisions is really hard even if there are some pieces of advice found on the Internet.</p>
<p>You confirmed my thought about many “alternative” pages – I saw it on the Help Scout’s site (I found them via one of their VS. pages by the way). We even already have a comparison table in the press kit, so journalists can easily understand what’s so unique about this app. The Groove example is amazing, also they’ve probably got a larger word count than my landing page has. I saw some stats that Google really likes ~2000 words pages and ranks long content with lots of media better.</p>
<p>Idea with “for [target_group”] pages is great and we can use these pages for teaching the app’s advanced features. Automatic project tracking has a higher entry threshold than just a RescueTime-style passive productivity tracking – I recently got a question where’s the start/stop tracking button in the app…</p>
<p>Microsites – brb, need to buy more domains. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>[quote=“SteveMcLeod, post:21, topic:1630”]<br>
I don’t think it is too late to change the name if you are in this for the long haul. You’ll have a short-term loss but a long-term gain. 301 redirects from an old site to a new site will ensure Google keeps most of your rankings.[/quote]<br>
You are right. Again, I wish we fixed it a year ago instead of submitting it to different directories in the last months but I saw many products that have “formerly [worse_name]” near the logo. I also started to wonder if some journalists and bloggers read the pitch but didn’t reply because they stumbled over the name (ironically, I’m using Newton Mail for read receipts and they renamed it from CloudMagic last year or so).</p>
<p>Do you think it’s ok stay on the company’s site that’s not very memorable either? We can buy a domain for a new app name and do a 301 redirect – I would like to continue to raise <a href="http://QotoQot.com" rel="nofollow noopener">QotoQot.com</a> domain authority because we’ll have more products in future. People don’t remember small developers’ names anyway.</p>

            <p>I checked your site. It is excellent and informative, your product is great, and the writing on your website is clear and direct. But for SEO purposes, your site is currently not good.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need much more content</li>
<li>Create one or more “Alternative to ${dominant_product}” pages</li>
<li>Create many long tail pages</li>
<li>Create a microsite whose domain name is an exact search query match</li>
</ul>
<h2>Create an “Alternative to RescueTime” article</h2>
<p>In this discussion, you perfectly summed up why Qbserve is better than RescueTime. This info is not on your website. It should be. “Versus” articles and “alternative to” articles both do very well with SEO. Write an article for your website called “Qbserve vs RescueTime” or “Qbserve: an alternative to RescueTime”. Make sure the slug and H1 tag both contain the text “RescueTime”. Don’t try to be fair or impartial; just as no-one expects a “Why Chrome instead of Firefox” article on Google’s website to be fair, it is implicitly understood by readers that your article is biased towards your product. List the advantages of Qbserve over RescueTime.</p>
<p>Groove does this very well by comparing themselves to FreshDesk: <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/vs/freshdesk">https://www.groovehq.com/vs/freshdesk</a>. Groove claims that this single page is responsible for a lot of their traffic, even though they have a ton of other excellent content. (Here’s also an example of how quickly things change in our industry. A few years ago, FreshDesk positioned themselves against ZenDesk as David vs Goliath. Now FreshDesk is Goliath to Groove’s David. FreshDesk, btw, currently gets 10,000 signups every 40 days, according to their UK General Manager!)</p>
<p>Notice that Groove has a link to “Versus” article in the footer of every page on their website. Groove are famous for their smart use of content for marketing; imitating them in this regard is probably a very good thing to do.</p>
<p>Tips: Don’t compare yourself to competitors your size or smaller; they’ll benefit from this as much as you do. Do compare yourself to any dominant competitors, especially those that have the top Google rankings for your desired queries.</p>
<h2>Create long tail pages such as “Mac Time Tracker for Developers”</h2>
<p>Ranking well for “mac time tracker” will always be hard and highly competitive. So try ranking for, say, “mac time tracker for developers” and other similar search queries. Each of these will only give small amounts of traffic. However, you’ll completely own the search results for these queries. Doing so should in the long term lift your entire site in Google’s eyes.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/andy">@Andy</a> mastered this idea with the website for his product, PerfectTablePlan. Some of his pages include “Creating Wedding Reception Table Plans” and “Masonic table plans”.</p>
<h2>Create a Microsite with a domain name that exactly matches a search query</h2>
<p>If you want to do really well for a specific keyword, consider a microsite, whose URL is the exact search term. “<a href="http://mactimetracker.com">mactimetracker.com</a>” is taken, but you can still get “<a href="http://mactimetrackers.com">mactimetrackers.com</a>” and “<a href="http://timetrackerformac.com">timetrackerformac.com</a>”. Even a one page site works, if the content is highly focused. Don’t overinvest in it, though; in general it is better to make your product’s website better.</p>
<h2>The name of your product</h2>
<p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="/u/kjk">@kjk</a>: Qbserve is really a terrible name for SEO. I’m a paid user of your product, I’ve been using it daily for almost a year, and I still can’t remember the name. And pronouncing it? No idea! Qbserve launches at startup for me, but when I’ve accidentally closed it and I need to manually start it, all I can do is  check everything in my Applications folder to find it again. Not even seeing the name helps me; my brain simply rejects the name as some obscure server product; the icon is what I use to find it.</p>
<p>I don’t think it is too late to change the name if you are in this for the long haul. You’ll have a short-term loss but a long-term gain. 301 redirects from an old site to a new site will ensure Google keeps most of your rankings.</p>
<p>Some general advice</p>
<ul>
<li>Be patient; the days of implementing a few tricks and shooting to the top of Google are long gone. Expect to spend one day a week for at least six months of working on improving your SEO. Google does seem to reward both site age and frequency of updates. But mostly age.</li>
<li>Measure your results weekly using both Google Search Console and Google Analytics.</li>
<li>Try many different types of content, then after a couple of months check how each piece is doing. You’ll be surprised by which content works, and you’ll be surprised by the keywords that work.</li>
<li>Keep track of the top 20 results for your best search terms; when you notice a competitor make a sharp improvement, try to work out what they did and whether it is something you could do too.</li>
</ul>

</aside>
<p>Yes, I’m not happy with the product name in the end (promoting it in podcasts? heh, no) but we really hit the wall back then trying to find something unique and gave up, probably too early. I was very frustrated with polishing the famous “last 10%” before the release and the app basically got its internal name. Now it’s too late to change. The company name is awkward but it was done on purpose – to stand out.</p>
<p>Anyway, our competitors are sometimes called like “Chrometa”, “Caato”, “Toggl” – they have nothing time-related in the domain but rank higher because of the age, content, and relevant backlinks.</p>

<p>This was the idea from the beginning. RT is stagnated and server-dependent, there’s basically no alternative with similar features. It’s also much more expensive if you need advanced options. Dozens of RT users migrated to our app because of these issues (and probably hundreds, I’m speaking for the ones who wrote it to me).</p>

<p>An obvious SEO 101 improvement would be to buy <a href="http://mac-software-time-tracker-application.com" rel="nofollow noopener">mac-software-time-tracker-application.com</a> domain name.</p>
<p>Google gives the highest rank to domain name, then to url, then to title/h1, then to page content.</p>
<p>The domain name you picked and the product name are awful.</p>
<p>Rule of thumb: if I can’t pronounce the name, it’s bad. I can’t pronounce “qbserve” or “qotoqot”.</p>
<p>That being said, there’s no way you’ll out-SEO 100 other time trackers, even if you do everything right.</p>
<p>At least some of your competitors are also doing everything right and they’ve been doing it it much longer (age of the website is a SEO boost).</p>
<p>You really compete with RescueTime, which has been around forever and has a free version.</p>
<p>The product is really polished. You can write high-quality software for Mac, which is important because it opens up opportunities.</p>
<p>My advice is to pick a product that has less competition, higher value to users, one where you can outdo them on quality.</p>
<p>Just off the top of my head:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you write file compare (like <a href="http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/</a>), you compete with 2-3 products</li>
<li>if you write a git client, you compete with 2-3 products</li>
<li>if you write a GUI PostgreSQL client, you compete mostly with 1 mac native product (postico) and I don’t know any GUI client company that does SEO well. This area is so rich with SEO opportunities because there’s countless useful posts that you can write about Postgres so if you have a good quality product you can out-SEO others. That is not true when it comes to time tracking</li>
<li>or duplicate <a href="https://screenhero.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://screenhero.com/</a>. It was a successful 4 person startup but they killed the stand-alone product when they were acquired by Slack. As far as I know, no one has tried to clone it. It’s not easy, it must be cross-platform (mac and windows) but it’s a validated idea</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not about specific ideas.</p>
<p>My point is that there is a category of software that has proven utility to users (like time tracking), so you don’t have to worry that if you build and market it, no-one will care. But unlike time tracking, there’s less competition and more opportunity to market via SEO.</p>
<p>Time tracking is not good for SEO marketing because there’s only so much you can write about time tracking.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL GUI client is perfect for SEO marketing because there’s no limit to how much you can write. Documentation is always lacking there. You can write a book about Postgres, which would be a great, evergreen content. On every release you can write about new features. You can write in-depth articles about some specific aspect, like date/time handling, json handling, performance investigation, and all of them can link to your app.</p>
<p>You seem to have programming skills to pull off a good quality product, you just have to apply those skills to a more profitable product category.</p>

            <p>On the landing page we have “time” 29 times and the “track-” root 16 times, I’m afraid doing more could be considered keyword stuffing.</p>
<p>But yes, I think we need to go for more pages with good content. I thought it wouldn’t be that hard for Mac-only queries because many competitors have small sites too but I believe they beat us with the age and 2-3 times larger backlink count. Even <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/addons/category/time-tracking" rel="nofollow noopener">this tiny addon list</a> for Freshbooks is ranked higher currently. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

            <p>About your particular case I think you have a few issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ranking a single page site is hard.</li>
<li>You need further on-page optimization: Titles, url, heading, keyword density all those things are sending another signal to google. Unless I go it wrong and your keyword is not Mac Time Tracking.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’vent looked your link profile; but, looks like you are after a competitive niche.</p>

            <p>The most mysterious part here is that we completely remade the site in May but there’s very little effect overall.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time on optimizing and rewriting texts to match different keywords better (both popular and low-volume), got important things above-the-fold (for the first version we cloned <a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical" rel="nofollow noopener">Fantastical 2 layout</a> that is not very informative), fixed technical issues like lack of GZIP and resource caching, optimized image sizes…</p>
<p>Bounce rate went from 72% to 60%, session duration grew from 00:54 to 01:20, pages/session – from 1.38 to 1.7, conversions to downloads went up for 2-4% depending on the channel. But there’s almost no change in search result positions after 3 weeks. Maybe it needs even more time, like 2 months?</p>

            <p>Average session duration is 01:20, HTTPS is enabled, and the site is using Bootstrap 3 to be mobile-first. I read lots of detailed SEO guides, like the one on <a href="http://Moz.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moz.com</a>, and optimized everything is possible for a small site.</p>
<p>Checked it with a couple of SEO checkers and got top score on them, also got Google PageSpeed score to 70 on mobile and 88 on desktop. (Mobile could be better maybe but 70% of visitors are searching desktop app and using macOS.)</p>
<p>Bounce rate is 60% but I guess it’s tolerable for a landing page. But we don’t have much content besides the landing, FAQ, and utility pages like EULA and Privacy Policy. That’s why I’m thinking about starting a blog and producing something that can be linked to, reposted to big sites with a backlink, found for long tail search queries, etc.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It is probably not the <em>only</em> way, but creating quality content is indeed important.</p>
<p>I’m no SEO expert, but I do spend time every week honing our SEO. As a result, over the last two years, we’ve gone from an average of position 19 to an average of position 3 for our most important search term. Some other alleged indicators that Google uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do people tend to bounce back very quickly to the search results page after clicking to your site? That’s a negative. Do they stay for a while? That’s a positive.</li>
<li>Do you use HTTPS throughout? The jury is out, but Google suggests you’ll get a small plus for this</li>
<li>Is your site mobile friendly? If so, Google possibly ranks you higher on search devices</li>
<li>Is your content updated from time to time? If so, Google possibly likes that</li>
</ul>
<p>However, frequently adding quality content that addresses issues your potential customers might have does seem to outweigh everything else!</p>

            <p>I hope nobody minds if I revive this useful thread.</p>
<p>So is creating quality unique content or some viral stuff is the only way up in search results? Our Mac app is getting outranked to the 3rd page by really old reviews just because they are on a popular site. Or some semi-abandoned competitors because they were released before 2010.</p>
<p>It’s really noisy nowadays plus many review sites died in 2015-2016, like <a href="http://appstorm.net" rel="nofollow noopener">AppStorm</a>. At least we have a B2C product that can gather some press (though has a trouble doing it currently) but I wonder how do you solve it for services that are not hip enough for any tech news.</p>

<p>A great read, I got burnt on it myself. SEO specialists that you can afford as a bootstrapper will do basically what free “SEO check” sites and a <a href="http://Moz.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moz.com</a> 30 day trial can do.</p>

            <p>Hi TF,<br>
I have always done best with a qualified approach.  I find that if you go to the doctor you are prescribed drugs, if you go to the phsio you are prescribed weekly sessions.  If you go to the SEO providers your now buying expensive links or blog networks.</p>
<p>I do it myself for the most part but definitely seek a person who tracks their success on sales and is continually experimenting with different methods.  I find those experts that are prescribing one method are far more interested in their scaling up their biz than they are in your sales.  In reality nobody knows what is going to be successful with your audience since all audiences are different.</p>
<p>For example I ran my competitors (and my site) through <a href="http://Alexa.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Alexa.com</a> and found that none of us had more than 9% of traffic coming from Google.  Often you will find its far less than 20% of people find popular sites through Google.  The majority of that 20% uses Google as a shortcut to find the website with short hand search.  So it really isn’t that fruitful to focus on search engine rankings especially with the expense of SEO these days.</p>
<p>Another area to investigate is how many conversions are you getting from your current content.  You can determine this through Google Analytics quickly and easily.  Producing content targeted at good converting keywords has definitely given me a good boost in sales.  No paid links, or anything, just producing articles and a continual stream of them for things I know my customers are searching for.</p>
<p>Another area, that seems to be a swear word in the internet marketing world, is to approach customers directly.  For example, I have utilized free audiences looking for related products in Craigslist - this method drives about 40% of my sales.</p>
<p>Also realizing that a lot of customers need a warm up period before buying.  For example a free email course that gives them a chance to see your product or service for free has worked very well for me.</p>
<p>I haven’t experimented with it yet but a free webinar (advertised in the right place) with a pitch of your product is a very good means of allowing them to see your product without risk.  John Lee Dumas knocks it out of the park with this method.</p>
<p>I would really look for a service or person that is focused on a number of techniques and quantifies them with a feedback loop for sales.  The one stop approach just doesn’t work.</p>
<p>I hope that helps, feel free to shout.</p>

            <p>After years of trying to hire someone I have finally come to the conclusion, that SEO is way too sensitive and important to be outsourced. It’s way too easy to screw things up. With AdWords, Facebook ads, Twitter ads, etc. screwing things up means losing money. With SEO screwing up may cost you business.</p>
<p>Hire “executors” for your SEO tasks - like, say, content creators and writers, freelancers for dumb jobs (like “go find all blogs in niche XXX, sort by PR, send a personal guest-blog proposal” or “write a press-release, find journalists on twitter, approach” etc. etc. But keep this starship’s bridge to yourself.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree, but I also have done enough mobile app development to understand that poor economics makes it artificially difficult to grow your business. You can’t invest in growth because you don’t have the money to do so. If you don’t invest in growth, it is very difficult to grow.</p>
<p>Also, there can be equally bad economics on the SEO side depending on the cost of your time or hiring someone else to do your content or link building. Articles can cost anywhere for $3 for super low end stuff to $150+ for high end stuff. Producing audio or video has a significant cost too. Link building or social media marketing is pretty much the cost of someone’s time for however long they do it.</p>
<p>My point is that if bad economics exist in your business, the answer isn’t to try and figure out how to cheaply advertise a business with poor margins and high costs, it’s to figure out a better model that you can sustainably promote.</p>
<p>I’ve had to learn this lesson and I’ve moved away from consumer apps, mobile apps, AdSense and affiliate sites, to business oriented SAAS software.</p>

<p>I’ve had some success with SEO, but I’d rather build a business using paid advertising to get it off the ground and then be able to invest in SEO. If your only avenue of business growth is SEO, it’s going to be a long, slow ramp to any kind of success.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is a conclusion that I have come to as well.</p>
<p>One of my projects has fantastic word of mouth referral and direct traffic. However, I think our competitors are eating our lunch because they out-rank us. We are 2nd page for all of the important terms in a very focused and specific niche.</p>
<p>The other project will absolutely not work with paid search due to the economics. It’s not a product that has any relevance to my personal interests, so building and audience and real relationships related to that one is gonna be a challenge. I think SEO is really the way to go with it but I think it’s gonna be a long, slow process.</p>
<p>On a related note, I’m considering shutting down or selling that project. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Thanks for the answer. Great food for thought.</p>

            <p>Great question. Thanks for calling me out on my poorly justified statement.</p>
<p>Here’s a little more context on what I’m thinking. My statement may or may not valid given this context.</p>
<p>I plan on making a living for myself and my family by building and running software businesses for the rest of my life. As such I believe I should be knowledgeable in the various customer and traffic acquisition channels that are prominent at any point in time.</p>
<p>A given business may or not require one or more of the available channels.</p>
<p>Some businesses may run 100% on paid placement.</p>
<p>Some businesses may thrive based on the word of mouth promotion of a engaged community. Maybe you can launch a business with an email list and grow it via word of mouth buzz created by the audience on your list.</p>
<p>However, for many businesses search ranking is a very powerful and important acquisition channel. Search is generally a high “intent” channel, whereas social media referral is often very low intent.</p>
<p>For that reason, I think search is one of the more important channels to understand for many businesses. If you can make paid search work, it is the easier to control and tune of two the search channels. However, for many businesses the unit economics of paid search make it unviable. That leaves organic search as the only search channel for those businesses.</p>
<p>Side note: SEO is such an overloaded word. All I mean by it is understanding how to drive organic search traffic.</p>
<p>All of that being said, I will reiterate that there are many businesses where pursuing organic search as an acquisition channel is not only non-optimal, it is a complete waste of time and money. If you are building a business exclusively in one of those channels then my statement would in no way apply to you.</p>
