    <title>Looking for SaaS business owner to interview for school project</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/looking-for-saas-business-owner-to-interview-for-school-project/1548</link>
    <description>Hi 

I have a career project in which I am supposed to interview an entrepreneur; someone who runs a small software company. This company has application(s) with some monthly recurring revenue. If you would be willing to accept the interview over email I would very much appreciate it. I would like to get  your name , address , company name, and job title. The interview will be 15 questions that you may answer at your own leisure, and I would need them back 3 weeks from now. Again thank you in advance.
