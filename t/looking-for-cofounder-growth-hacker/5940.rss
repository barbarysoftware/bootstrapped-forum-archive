    <title>Looking for cofounder/growth-hacker</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/looking-for-cofounder-growth-hacker/5940</link>
    <description>Hey,

I&#39;m currently working on a SaaS targeted for developers. Not that much to share right now but the service is going to be available on the GitHub marketplace.
I have experience building these kinds of products + a plan for the first couple of weeks. You can join me as a cofounder, or as a contractor with a base salary and bonuses tied to MRR.

If you are interested, send me a PM telling me why you are the right person for the job. I&#39;ll get back to you with details.

Thanks!</description>

<p>How someone could say why he is right person for a job when there is no details?</p>
<p>The best you could receive will be “I know what is SaaS and love Github marketplace”</p>
<p>The honest message can only express some interest for more details</p>
