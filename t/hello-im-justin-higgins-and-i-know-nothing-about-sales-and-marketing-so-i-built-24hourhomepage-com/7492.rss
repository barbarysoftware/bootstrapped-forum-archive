    <description># Hello Bootstrapped !

I&#39;m Justin Higgins and I know nothing about sales and marketing.

Let me explain.

I&#39;ve been a professional software engineer for over 10 years now and have wanted to build something of my own. I&#39;ve tried a few side projects but have had a pretty big flaw in my thinking execution:

I never wanted to *sell or market* my work.

That&#39;s no good.

So I built **24hourhomepage (dot) com** in order to get better at sales and marketing.

The service is simple:
There are 86,400 seconds in a day and each is sold as an advertisement. Once each second is sold, the project is over and the site lives on indefinitely as an internet artifact.

## Why would I advertise here?

There are endless reasons why people are advertising on **24hourhomepage (dot) com**, but here are a few:

### 1. Cost 💰

Traditional digital advertisements are expensive and often based on pay-per-click (PPC) model. Here, you buy your ad once and keep it forever.

### 2. Captive and engaged audience 👀

24hourhomepage (dot) com visitors ***want*** to click an ad. There is no better engagement out there. For viewers who set us as their homepage, they’re not only **an engaged audience** they’re **a captive audience.**

### 3. Have fun with your brand 🏄‍♂

You can “hide” discounts or jokes on the site as easter eggs for your customers. It&#39;s cost effective and lets your customers know you aren&#39;t afraid to have fun.

### 4. Vanity 💎

You can tell everyone you &quot;own&quot; a piece of the day. Or buy your sweetie her birthsecond. Or invest in your idea by claiming the link won&#39;t be dead far in the future.

### 5. Money back guarantee 💯

All sales are made with a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you want a refund, you get a refund. 

# I&#39;d love to hear your feedback 👂

            <p>Thanks for your question, yinhowlew! Right now i’m doing direct sales and marketing by reaching out to content creators i think could make engaging pieces (to “hide” for discoverability) and to get the word out a bit more. I’ve considered an embedded advertising strategy but its not in my immediate plans. I’ll consider it again</p>
<p>I’m documenting my efforts at <span class="mention">@higgins</span> (medium) and <span class="mention">@justinprojects</span> (twitter) if you want to see how I’m growing it.</p>

            <p>Congrats on launching. Really fun product! reminds me of the million dollar homepage back in the days but with a more fun and engaging twist.</p>
<p>As a business, my natural first question is: what are your plans to get visitors to your site?  It seems like something people might check out 1 time, but has little incentive to return.</p>
<p>Or maybe you are planning other distribution strategy - e.g. having the square embed to other websites / apps?</p>
