    <title>My SEO checklist for blog posts</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/my-seo-checklist-for-blog-posts/7352</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s the checklist we work through when publishing blog posts for [Saber Feedback](https://saberfeedback.com/). Maybe it is useful to you too.

Some of this checklist is specific to the way we use Jekyll.

---

After a blog post is written or updated, check the following before and after publishing:

## Content

- Has the copy been proof-read by another human being?
- Is the publish date correct? 
- If updating an existing post, have you changed the publish date to the date of the update?
- Is the category correct?
- Is the permalink correctly based on the page title and target keyword? For example the blog post &quot;Does your business need a user feedback tool&quot; is targeting the keyword &quot;user feedback tool&quot;, so the permalink should be &quot;/blog/user-feedback-tool/&quot;
- Is the permalink all lower case and ending with a forward slash?

## Title

- Does the HTML &quot;Title&quot; represent the page theme?
- Is the Title between 40 and 65 characters long? (preferably max 60; don&#39;t include product name)
- Does the page title use &quot;sentence case&quot;? That is, only first word and proper nouns capitalised.

## Description

- Does the HTML description meta tag offer a snippet that is suitable for the Google search results page?
- Is the description between 50 and 300 characters long, but ideally up to 160 characters?
- Do the description and title address the needs of the searcher, and not just push our product?

## Links

- Does the link to the page in the blog article list look correct?
- Do all images have suitable alt tags?
- Do all links work and open the intended page?
- Are internal links correctly excluding the domain name?
- Do we have incoming internal links pointing to this page?

## Appearance

- Does the page render as expected on mobile?
- Do all images render well on retina displays? normal displays? mobile devices?

## Promotion

- Has the blog post been promoted on our social media channels?</description>
