I offer consulting and training on Python, Linux, C, open source technologies, relational databases, and on PDF generation for businesses or other organizations, using my xtopdf toolkit or related tools and technologies (of which I know a fair number).
I have solid strengths developed over many years in the aforementioned areas.

Looking forward to checking this site and interacting with the members.

Cheers,
Vasudev
