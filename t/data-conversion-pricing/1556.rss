    <title>Data conversion pricing</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/data-conversion-pricing/1556</link>
    <description>For my software something that people often ask for, and is important for getting new users on board, is data conversion from their old software. Currently I do this for free, but as it often takes 2-4 hours I am considering charging, something along the $200 mark.

However, I don&#39;t want this cost to be a barrier to entry so what do you think are the best options.

- Only pay if they sign up for a subscription
- Buy a 12 month subscription and get data conversion free
- Spread the cost over the first 12 months
- Something else

Thanks
Craig

            <p>I like the strategy of having a highest priced tier that includes free migration/conversion. You could also do that on any annual plan, but I would consider offering it only on higher priced ones. Of course, I don’t know the details of your pricing currently.</p>
