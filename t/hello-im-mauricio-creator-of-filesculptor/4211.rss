    <title>Hello, I&#39;m Mauricio creator of FileSculptor</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hello-im-mauricio-creator-of-filesculptor/4211</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a long time reader of Joel&#39;s business of software forum, and this seems to be the new place too meet people in the software business.

My current product is a CSV/XLSX/XLS data file converter for Windows at FileSculptor.com

My users like FileSculptor because it allows them to process CSV and XLSX files without Excel and because it works from the command prompt, which is great for batch jobs.

I&#39;ve been working on it in the last two years and intend to continue for may more, adding features like support for JSON and XML and more automation. If Joel is right and successful software takes ten years, there&#39;s still a long journey ahead for me... :sweat_smile:</description>
