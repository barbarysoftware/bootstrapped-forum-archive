            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/stevemcleod">@SteveMcLeod</a> thanks again for having me on the podcast. Sorry I’ve been a bit absent from the conversations here but will be remedying that here going forward.</p>
<p>Would love to hear if anyone has had success in using public speaking as a way to grow their business like Steve talked about during the episode?  One of those Traction channels that Gabriel talks about in his book?</p>
