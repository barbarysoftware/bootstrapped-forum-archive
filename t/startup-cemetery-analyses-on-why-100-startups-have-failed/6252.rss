    <title>Startup Cemetery - Analyses on why +100 startups have failed</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/startup-cemetery-analyses-on-why-100-startups-have-failed/6252</link>
    <description>Hey [Bootstrapped.fm!](http://Bootstrapped.fm!) Today, I am really enthusiastic 😝

After 6 months of research, data collection, writing, designing and development, I&#39;ve finally launched [Startup Cemetery](https://www.failory.com/cemetery), a BIG resources in which I&#39;ve analyzed why +100 startups have failed!

The last 3 months of building this side-project have been quite difficult. The truth is that I had fear of launch and I was always postponing the launch day. I always felt as if there were features missing and wanted to add new information to each business page.

The strategy I found to avoid putting off the launch day was to contact Kevin William David and scheduled a PH launch day with him. [I can now proudly say Startup Cemetery is featured in Product Hunt!](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/startup-cemetery) ☺️

Over 35,000 words of content on how companies like Vine, Yik Yak and Netscape have failed. Use the filters if you want to search for a specific industry, country or cause of failure, or just click the &quot;Surprise Me!&quot; button if you want to be redirected to a random startup!

I&#39;m so enthusiastic about this project, so I would love to know your opinion about it on the comments 😉</description>

            <p>I like your “Surprise me” button and the cause of failure “Acquisition Flu” made me literally LoL!</p>

            <p>Good site. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I was surprised to see “Sunrise” in there (<a href="https://www.failory.com/cemetery/sunrise" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.failory.com/cemetery/sunrise</a>). I absolutely loved that app, but they suddenly discontinued it and pulled it out from under me (ie. I can’t use it anymore because they purposely stopped that). Had no idea why, but it mightily p*ssed me off at the time. So I don’t feel sorry for them at all for failing - they treated their users like garbage!</p>
