    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/imriel-a-writer-looking-for-startups-to-showcase-on-medium/3050</link>
    <description>I&#39;m starting a project called Jumpstart which showcases small startups that are looking to hire their first employee(s)  It it&#39;s not like Beta list. There are only 5 questions to answer about your who you are looking for, the brand, culture and the founding team. If anyone is interested in being featured just let me know and I&#39;ll send you the questions. If you are a larger company we have a separate project  which I&#39;m happy to discuss. The features will likely be featured on Medium.</description>
