    <title>Data protection laws in the US</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/data-protection-laws-in-the-us/4911</link>
    <description>Imagine there is a company that is headquartered out of the US. They have a desktop CRM type system and the database is encrypted to make access difficult, which they could argue it a valid security measure. However, if the user of the software no longer wishes to use the software and asks to be given a dump in CSV, Excel or similar the company refuses. They could have years of important business information and if they don&#39;t pay the ongoing fee this would be lost. 

Has anyone dealt with this and have any ideas what can be done to force them to allow exporting of the information?</description>
