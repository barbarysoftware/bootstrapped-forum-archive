    <title>Bundling software with a twist, but how to market</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/bundling-software-with-a-twist-but-how-to-market/4298</link>
    <description>I was reading a medium article post (linked below) and today or yesterday i was reading here and the idea occurred to me about bundling On-Premise versions of SaaS software but as a service.

The post on here about SaaS vs On-Prem (apologies i will add the link after writing this post) made think about when AppSumo (now SumoMe) first started out they sometimes bundled apps to sell with a count down etc etc.

So i thought about combining the 2 thought streams , a Managed on-premises bundling of apps for people to purchase as a whole.
i.e. purchase a hosted jira,  TeamCity, OctopusDeploy .....

Note it doesn&#39;t have to be build stuff that&#39;s just my fall back products 
Not sure how whee to market but ....

            <p>I’m the author of that post. Thanks for sharing it. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>SaaS has the potential to be disrupted if the customer really, really wants:</p>
<ul>
<li>a different form factor</li>
<li>a different pricing / licensing model</li>
</ul>
<p>This will differ from industry to industry.</p>
<p>To answer your question I’ll ask you a question:</p>
<p>Have you observed the pain you’re trying to fix? Do you know people in your market who really really want it?</p>
<p>(I talk about this more in today’s newsletter: <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/change/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://justinjackson.ca/change/</a>)</p>

<p>I believe such bundles are marketed as “appliances” – a ready-to-use servers with all required packages installed. Google search appliance comes in mind, some routers are distributed as appliances… only these days the appliance doesn’t have to be real; it could be a VMware image, for instance.</p>
<p>Back in some days PHP+Apache+MySQL was distributed as a package to install on Windows (targeted at PHP developers) … JIRA in its early versions was delivered as a Tomcat+DB+JIRA itself.</p>
<p>… So the model is not exactly new, and I’d say it is proven.</p>
<p>Having said that, in the context of the post you provided, a bundle is not disrupting SaaS; it still competes with on-premise applications. SaaS vendors will still have a cost of ownership edge over such a bundled solution; for instance, Atlassian provides a bundle of their applications together online - with the same goal to reduce buyers integration pains, but at a fraction of a cost you may be able to charge for a on-premise bundle profitably.</p>
