    <description>Hello, I&#39;m Drew, and I work with my wife @rachelandrew at edgeofmyseat.com, mostly working on [Perch CMS](http://grabaperch.com/). It&#39;s probably best to read [Rachel&#39;s introduction](http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/im-rachel-andrew-of-edgeofmyseat-com/15) for context on our business.

Personally, I dropped out of university in the late 90s after finding studying Computing with Management was way less interesting that all the freelance web development jobs I was being offered. From that point I worked in a lot of web design agencies as a developer, and then in 2006 took a job at Yahoo! in London, working in Search R&amp;D.

I was never a very good employee. I didn&#39;t know why until I joined up with Rachel as a partner in edgeofmyseat.com. Rachel and I can discuss and idea in the morning and ship it in the afternoon without needing anyone&#39;s sign-off - we can do our own thing based on our own judgement. Sometimes we&#39;re even right!

Anyway, that&#39;s me. Pleased to be here.

            <p>Welcome, Drew! Nice to have you here.</p>
<p>I’m with you on the “never being a good employee” thing. But I’m beginning to suspect, as I get older, that it may mostly have been the cause of not finding a good company to work for. As I’ve consulted with a few people over the years, I’ve found at least a few companies that, if I had been a full-time employee there, I’d probably have liked it.</p>
