    <title>Looking for feedback - Frustration Free Online Teaching &amp; Training</title>

    <description>Hello all, 

Teaching online is very difficult. Are students paying attention? Have they grasped concepts or sleeping at leisure? These queries take a toll on tutors.

Multiple apps are literally overkill for 30 minutes class. One app for scheduling. Different communication app to reminder. Email or phone to share assignment &amp; results. Jamboard for white-boarding. Manually reminder to even pay attention. 

This exercise makes mental tall on teachers. We&#39;ve built Standupmeet for teaching and training.

**Collaborative Whiteboard:**
Super easy to draw objects. Showcase any documents on whiteboard. 

**Cohort Based Education:**
Implement true peer learning with Standupmeet. Create multiple study zones and divide students.

**Take Instant Quiz or Poll:**
Are students paying attention? Have they grasped concept. Take instant quiz and learn where students are in learning.

**Integrated Library &amp; Assignments**
I don&#39;t need to force students to use Google Drive or dropbox. During classes only, they can upload assignments in library.

Share Screen, Video Conferencing
You don&#39;t need to use different apps for sharing screen or video conference. 

Standupmeet is now live. Signup for free now and share your feedback.</description>
