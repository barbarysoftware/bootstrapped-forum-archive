    <description>Hi all,

My name is Eric Lamb and I&#39;m the founder of [mithra62](https://mithra62.com/) and one of the co-founders of [VITY](http://www.vity.co/). mithra62 was founded over 4 years ago and is actually going nicely though I&#39;ve recently realized I needed to step things up quite a bit in order to maximize its potential. And VITY is a new startup I help found last year that has gone through a nightmare of partner disappointments to be reborn lately with a vengeance. So things are pretty good. 

Still though, I&#39;m hoping to learn how best to market my products moving forward, something I&#39;ve realized I&#39;m ill equipped for on my own, so I&#39;m here to soak up what I can and help where I can.

            <p>Yeah, mithra62 has a pretty set customer base. Developers. Done and done <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>That said, I am shaking things up there a bit by focusing on a single product instead of the previous “stable” I currently have. But I’ll make that a separate topic.</p>
<p>Right now, we’re mostly marketing through dog-fooding the platform. I mean, why build a marketing platform and NOT use it to market our self, you know? Still, there’s a point of diminishing returns and circular reach we’re obviously up against so am looking to expand into actual marketing. With goals even!</p>

            <p>Welcome Eric.</p>
<p>mithra62 seems like a very targeted product. Vity seems a vague. How are you marketing it?</p>
