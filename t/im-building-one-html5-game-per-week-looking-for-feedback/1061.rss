    <title>I&#39;m building one html5 game per week, looking for feedback</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/im-building-one-html5-game-per-week-looking-for-feedback/1061</link>
    <description>Hello,

Since the iPhone came out, I really want to build fun games for smartphones. But a) I have no idea how to make games, and b) I don&#39;t have any audience that may be interested in my games.

To solve both problems, I threw myself a public challenge: build a free html5 game every week. So far I&#39;ve made 5 games, and I&#39;ve got a lot of positive feedback from players. 

For now most of my traffic comes from reddit and hackernews. Do you have any advice on where/how to promote my games to more people? I&#39;m also interested if you have feedback on the website or the games themselves.

**Link to the games: www.lessmilk.com**

Thanks for your help!</description>

            <p>Looks interesting!</p>
<p>PS- Why do posts have to be 20 words long, forcing me to type in random garbage??</p>
