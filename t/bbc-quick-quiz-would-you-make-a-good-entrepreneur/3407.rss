    <description>Interesting little diversion.

Turns out my inability to delegate and take advice makes me more suitable to be a sole trader. ;)

What did it tell you?</description>

            <p>If you look at the statistics it is very risky, I think it’s quite easy to discount how much of what you achieve is down to luck.</p>
<p>The media is particularly bad for this, you will never hear them say two guys get lucky and create Google, it doesn’t make a good story, but they were lucky, lucky to go to have educated parents, lucky to go to the right schools, lucky to have an interest in computer science, lucky to graduate at a point where the internet was taking off, lucky that Alta Vista was struggling, lucky that Microsoft’s eye was off the ball, and so on.</p>

            <p>Agreed.<br>
And entrepreneurship doesn’t have to be risky if you do it right.<br>
If you validate at each step of the journey it’s far less risky than spending an extra 2 years in college to get a Masters degree (where you only get to validate after 2 years).</p>

            <p>I got the same thing you did "inability to delegate"<br>
I’ve been running my successful software company for over 20 years now.</p>
<p>Many of the questions are poorly constructed:</p>
<p>The one about “how did you spend most of your time in teenage years”.<br>
When I was in elementary school I sold  cinnamon toothpicks (toothpicks soaked in cinnamon oil) and loved playing Lemonade Stand (“business” game on the Apple Iie).</p>
<p>And the one about  “<strong>how much time would you spend</strong>”. I did answer 10h/day 6d/week, but that’s a poor metric.<br>
WHAT you choose to work/focus on is far more important than HOW MANY HOURS you’re willing to work when you’re the boss. It’s really easy to miss how vital good direction is b/c we get it “free” when working for someone else.</p>

            <p>Found it a lot of bullshit.</p>
<p>Evidently, “real” entrepreneurs have been selling since they were in nursery, work 200 hours a week, take wild risks, but are doing it all not to make money or become their own bosses, but to “<em>to help the world a little.</em>”</p>
<p>I also got a condescending “You don’t take enough risks to become an entrepreneur, but that’s actually a good thing, because business is too risky for the likes of you. Haha.”</p>
<p>Reminds me of <a href="https://unicornfree.com/2014/mojito-island-entreporn-revisited" rel="nofollow noopener">Entreporn</a> by <a class="mention" href="/u/amyhoy">@amyhoy</a></p>
