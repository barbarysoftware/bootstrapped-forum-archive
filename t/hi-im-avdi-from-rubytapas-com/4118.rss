    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Avdi from RubyTapas.com</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-avdi-from-rubytapas-com/4118</link>
    <description>I found this forum through a really circuitous random google search connection, and then discovered there are people I know here!

So, Hi. I&#39;m Avdi. I&#39;m a programmer who now makes videos about programming for a living. And sometimes ebooks.

Much as I&#39;ve managed to make a success out of this business, I recently had the realization that I really need the ability to compare notes with other people doing similar stuff. And it seems like there are some other people who do similar stuff here.

I feel like I&#39;m sort of a &quot;raised by wolves&quot; boostrapper. On the one hand I&#39;m a success story, but on the other I have no idea what I&#39;m doing. I definitely out of touch with the &quot;lingo&quot; for this kind of business. E.g. I saw a post where someone hit 1,000 MRR (congrats!) and I had no idea what an MRR was. Turns out I have them too!

Anyway, happy to answer questions, but even happier to learn from other folks. Hi!</description>

            <p>Hello Avdi!</p>
<p>Despite my Java leanings (boo, hiss etc.), I’ve enjoyed reading your tweets and blog posts for a few years now, so I very much look forward to hearing about the business side of what you do.</p>

            <p>Welcome Avdi! You’re successful indeed, I know who you are (and heard about RubyTapas) from being in the Rails world. Amazing that you didn’t know what MRR was, great focus on execution <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/+1.png?v=5" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
