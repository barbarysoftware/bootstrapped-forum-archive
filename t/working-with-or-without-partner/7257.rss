    <title>Working with or without partner?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/working-with-or-without-partner/7257</link>
    <description>Hey guys. I’ve been in a startup world for years and I worked alone and with partners. I’m also searching for new opportunities and places to meet new partners.

I was wondering:

1. What is better for you? To work alone or with a partner?
2. Where did you find a partner?</description>

            <p>That’s okay, as long as they all fail for different reasons.</p>

            <p>I tried different areas like: adult, dating, social networking, crypto, web scraping, tele communications, leading semi-successful news portal… I can’t even remember what I’ve tried so far.</p>
<p>But it all failed</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/dadili">@dadili</a>,</p>
<p>generally I opt for alone as long as I don’t see strongly complementary skills (and the need for the skills). It also helps a lot to have “a history” together to know you can actually resolve issues… That’s my two cent coming from personal experience.</p>
<p>What kind of businesses have you started?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Peter</p>
