    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/saas-growth-and-team-performance-coach-here/7498</link>
    <description>My name is Natalie Luneva. 

I am a growth coach to SaaS founders, and I am also married to a SaaS founder. 

I am the host of SaaS Boss podcast and the founder of SaaS Boss Community (btw, join the group if you haven’t yet).

Enjoy my podcast episodes and my group for SaaS founders for free! Will be happy to see you at my live Q&amp;As and online summits I host.</description>
