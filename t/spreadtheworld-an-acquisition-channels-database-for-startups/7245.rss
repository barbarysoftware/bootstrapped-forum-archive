    <title>SpreadTheWorld - An Acquisition Channels Database for Startups</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/spreadtheworld-an-acquisition-channels-database-for-startups/7245</link>
    <description>Hey there,

I just launched my new project: [https://spreadtheworld.net/](https://spreadtheworld.net?utm_source=into-post&amp;utm_medium=bootstrapfm)

It’s a database of 400+ places where you can post your project and get your first users.

The idea came from a list of startup directories I curated to launch my previous startup. I posted it on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/im1q7y/i_curated_100_website_where_you_can_promote_your/) and get tons of upvotes.
So I decided to go deeper, provide more value for the makers/entrepreneurs, and make a product out of it!

It&#39;s still in a pre-order, so any feedback is more than welcome!</description>

            <p>Quick update on the project:</p>
<p>I launched officially a few days ago, on Twitter first then on IH.<br>
I already got some feedback from the early users (like <a class="mention" href="/u/ivm">@ivm</a>!) and started to improve it!</p>
<p>I’ll try to build in public as much as possible, so if you want to follow the journey → <a href="https://twitter.com/AngeZanetti">https://twitter.com/AngeZanetti</a></p>

            <p>There is all the Capterra, G2, GetApp yes! You’ll also find a list of blog that accept guest post.<br>
I curated a list of 3500+ journalist contacts, I was wondering if I should sell it as a new product or as an premium package.</p>

            <p>Hello from the Makerlog!</p>
<p>Looks good, despite there are many “small impact” places like CrunchBase, I will still buy this because collecting all those links will cost me much more than $19. I can’t see it in the preview but hopefully, there are also all the software catalogues like Capterra, G2, GetApp, SaaSHub, AlternativeTo, and those old-school Softpedia, Softonic, CNET’s Download-dot-com, etc.</p>
<p>By the way, I would pay a few dozens more for an up-to-date list of the reporters who still write about new B2C software. Reporters change jobs and “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_reporting">beats</a>” over time, so my list from 2017 is already too dated.</p>
