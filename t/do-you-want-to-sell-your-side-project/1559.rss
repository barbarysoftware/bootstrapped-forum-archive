    <title>Do you want to sell your Side Project?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/do-you-want-to-sell-your-side-project/1559</link>
    <description>@daverodenbaugh did a very [interesting talk][1] at MicroConf about  buying products instead of building them.

Some people (including him), mentioned today a [HN thread][2] where people were looking for a &quot;better home&quot; for side projects they just couldn&#39;t give enough attention anymore.  Among those, there was @shazow, a fellow bootstrapper from this forum.   

I just wonder... are there other people in this community with side projects they wish they could give a better future? 

Do **you** have any side project you would like to sell?

            <p>I have a ton of properties across the net.  Some that could make some real money if converted to mobile apps.  Been building for a while, but don’t want to give them up.  Because if I could just invest a bit more time in them, I think they would be great properties…</p>

            <p>If anyone is curious,</p>
<p>I received a combined ~14,000 visits across all my properties from that one comment. Pretty huge for just a comment. I’ve gotten less than that from frontpage submissions before.</p>
<p>Also received about ~17 acquisition inquiries, most for Tweepsect. None really panned out though. Only a couple ended up near my sell price.</p>
<p>At the very least, it got me thinking about the value of these things. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
