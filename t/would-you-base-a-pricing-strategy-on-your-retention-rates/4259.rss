    <title>Would you base a pricing strategy on your retention rates?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/would-you-base-a-pricing-strategy-on-your-retention-rates/4259</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently considering pricing strategy, and I have some retention data from GA to help inform me.

I&#39;ve not got an enormous amount of data yet, but consider these cohort analysis figures for retention (I&#39;ve deliberately smudged time periods, because I want it to be period agnostic. These could be days, weeks, months, years)...

Would you identify steep drops in retention at various points to try to pinpoint ideal time-based plans?

Or is this all irrelevant, because ultimately pricing is an exercise in perception, and what *actually* happens is less important?</description>

            <p>I also track retention rates and I would guess that you can use drop offs to re-engage people at certain times.</p>
<p>It’s definitely a pain to get right, that’s for sure.</p>
