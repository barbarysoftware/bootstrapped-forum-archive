    <description>Hi fellow bootstrappers.  Woke up today and my product made it on Product Hunt: PushForms.  I will do a full introduction later this week and recap to help out. 

As it stands now we got around 100 trial users.

            <p>The website UI/UX looks fantastic and the execution on the product itself (via what is shown on said website) looks well done. More than that, with the right exposure I believe it is a solid business idea. In fact, I had a similar idea in my back pocket. Now I know someone out there went and did a proper job on it; kudos!</p>

            <p>Congratulations Jeff. I looked at your website and it’s very clean and well designed.<br>
I’m in the process of redesigning mine. Would you mind if I get in touch with you privately for a few tips. Thanks a lot.</p>

            <p>It was completely by chance.  I posted another product and someone must have looked at my profile since I just added it to my twitter account and personal webpage the day before.</p>

            <p>Thanks,  should be interesting to see how the startup crowd takes to a tool with a real business use case.</p>
<p>Based on current usage Product Hunt trials seem to have created about 15% of what we call active trials (created a form, submitted a form, installed the application).</p>
