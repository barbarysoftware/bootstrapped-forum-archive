            <p>Thanks Ian.  Sorry for the late reply - I didn’t get an email notification!  (handle is <a class="mention" href="/u/kalenjordan">@kalenjordan</a>)</p>
<p>Ya I hear what you’re saying.  Actually what I’ve been doing recently is finding people on linkedin.  I like it better for a number of reasons - in most cases because I’m the same industry as these people they’re already a 2nd or 3rd degree contact.  So it’s a much warmer cold contact - and they can see my profile to see whether they’re interested in adding me.</p>
<p>But even there there’s still etiquette - a buddy of mine has been showing me the ropes as he lives and breathes this kind of thing for biz dev.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>I think the blogs do say it for a reason – because for the most part it works. I think after X emails sent you’re bound to get a response or a ‘unsubscribe’ action, just because people don’t like getting spam.</p>
<p>Being on the sending side, I have found that targeted emailing tends to work a lot better than just mass emailing. E.g. sending online video whitepapers to people who manage digital media has definitely started some conversations.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think the problem is that most cold calling books/blogs teach exactly that: If the person doesn’t reply, keep emailing them. This is supposed to show the person that you are a hard working and dedicated salesman, and s/he will be so impressed, they will give you their time (don’t look at me: These aren’t my thoughts).</p>

            <p><span class="mention">@kalen</span> If you’re actually reaching out to people based on research and not just blasting lists or churning through people you found via automated searches and stuff then I hate it slightly less.</p>
<p>Still in most context you see it used it’s used poorly. Also, I just got into a twitter battle on this with a company that was “cold emailing”. They basically refused to stop until I publicly called them out.</p>
<p>So I guess a lot is in the details. If you email someone and they don’t reply I don’t think you should keep emailing them/calling them until they do. That’s sleazy. Obviously if they tell you to get lost you should also stop.</p>
<p>If you’re going to do 1 personal, well researched email I suppose that’s something different. Though the temptation is so great to automate it and to harass people once you go down this road it seems risky to me.</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/ian">@ian</a> I’m curious - do you hate cold emails less when they’re highly relevant to you?</p>
<p>For example- assuming your saas apps are on rails and deal with email, how would you feel about a cold email about a rails email plugin or feature of some sort?</p>
<p>Reason I ask is I’m considering doing a bit of cold email to magento merchants for a magento plugin.</p>
<p>I actually received a cold email for some magento plugin to my work email and I actually found myself not that annoyed by it because it was actually fairly relevant to us.</p>
<p>That said I know cold commercial email is pretty well despised across the boards. So I’d understand if people were just completely against it on principle.</p>

            <p>There’s nothing I don’t hate about this, but that’s just my 2 cents as someone who receives these all the time .</p>
<p>I also doubt it’s going to be the thing that makes your business. Using these techniques to approach reporters is a bit different and there I’m more OK with it as they’re generally actively looking for interesting stories.</p>

            <p>Keep it short (max 5 lines, excluding signature).</p>
<p>Be personal and genuine, no corporate talking - people had enough.</p>
<p>Buy a good database with highly targeted people - forget about generic email addresses, they never work.</p>
<p>Set up Mailchimp so you monitor your opening rates and get other interesting metrics on your campaign.</p>
