    <description>Some of you probably know that UserScape helps support the Laravel PHP framework. We&#39;ve got the conference we run coming up next week and we&#39;re trying something new, live blogging. 

With both Laracon and other conferences we&#39;ve struggled to really make the $$$ investment in sponsoring them pay off. There&#39;s a little bit of branding upside in general, but very hard to convert your name on a screen in the lobby to sales.

I&#39;m hoping by live blogging we&#39;re able to provide a nice service for the folks who couldn&#39;t be there as well as we a lot more direct engagement with potential customers.

If any of you have live blogged an event before I&#39;d love to hear any tips or tricks you might have.

I&#39;ll also report back on how it goes.

If you want to check it out it&#39;s setup at the link below and the conference is May 15th and 16th.

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/ian">@ian</a> - I’ve benefitted from some of the resources/live blogs <a class="mention" href="/u/timschraeder">@TimSchraeder</a> has done.  The <span class="hashtag">#hashtag</span> suggestion is great.  I’ve also seen the PDF idea implemented well, too.  I didn’t have any issue giving my contact info in exchange for the resource.  Definitely a great additional touchpoint for you to gain value in your sponsorship.</p>
<p>I’m bummed I’ll miss Laracon (I was able to attend in DC) but am really glad to hear you’re offering a live blog.  Can’t wait for Taylor’s big reveals!</p>

            <p>Wow, spectacular feedback. Thanks! This is great.</p>
<p>I hadn’t considered the follow on PDF’s and such, we’ll definitely do that. Great stuff.</p>

            <p>I’ve done both live-blogging and live tweeting for conferences and events. Whatever your’e doing the conference <span class="hashtag">#hasthag</span> is your friend.  I always try to listen for the key ideas or thoughts that are the most quotable and tweetable.</p>
<p>If you’re live-tweeting, I would typically have the speakers <span class="mention">@handle</span> and conference <span class="hashtag">#hashtag</span> copy + pasted and ready to rock at all times to get your tweets as much as in real-time as possible. However, if you miss a few words or a point, searching the <span class="hashtag">#hashtag</span> can help you fill in any blanks you missed.</p>
<p>If you’re live blogging, much like above, I like giving people the main points and key thoughts communicated in bulleted fashion. There are great live blogging plugins, but I typically like to do a post at the end of each session and include the speaker bio, links to their online presence, books, resources, etc.</p>
<p>Another great thing to do is to take all of your blog posts or tweets and make them into a downloadable PDF. You can always set it up as a download in exchange for a follow or subscription to an email list. And if you’re representing a business or organization, you can embed an ad or two in the PDF.</p>
<p>Just a few thoughts.</p>
<p>The main idea, though, is to capture the quotable and sharable content. The things that people will want to remember and go back to.</p>

            <p>No problem!</p>
<p>Yeah, probably not something many people have tried. We’ll get <a class="mention" href="/u/alyssamazzina">@alyssamazzina</a> to write up the experience when it’s done and tell everyone where we screwed up <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
