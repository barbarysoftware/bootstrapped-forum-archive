    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Pierre. I set house concerts on lodj.org, a tool for musicians to book house concerts</title>

    <description>Hello ! Hello  everyone !

I have been reading this board from time to time. I like the &quot;down to earth&quot; feel of the community. It&#39;s like a calm island in the middle of all the hype in startup land.
 
I have been working on a project in my free time, to help musicians book house concerts tour.
here is the url: http://lodj.org

Basically house concerts are a great way to experience live music both for artists and people in the audience. While it has been around since forever, it&#39;s not as easy as it should to book them. 
I hope to build a community of house concerts advocates and to book them for artists.

I am looking for some advice from people not necessarily into music. About anything and especially about ways to grow a community. The website is as it is, I just had to push it at some point, but feel free to tell what you miss.

Cheers!

            <p>Hi Corey,</p>
<p>You are right it’s hard work, but I enjoy it. There is no money in it , and I can’t see how there can be, 'besides being able to have buy a couple of beers ). What I do that they don’t? Well there is not enough house concerts going on for my taste. So we might all need to drum it up a little bit. So I am focused on giving exposure. I think it’s a shame that this movement that has been going on for so long does not get more press. I am trying my best at it!</p>

            <p>I love this part of the music industry.  The intimate, informal shows are fantastic for both the audience &amp; performer, and house parties can really help bridge the “in between” spots in a road trip or tour.</p>
<p>I don’t know if there’s any money in it for you.  You’re creating a two-sided market, and you’ll need to work extra extra extra hard to attract enough hosts &amp; musicians to make it interesting for both parties.  What are you doing that <a href="http://www.concertsinyourhome.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.concertsinyourhome.com</a> isn’t?</p>
