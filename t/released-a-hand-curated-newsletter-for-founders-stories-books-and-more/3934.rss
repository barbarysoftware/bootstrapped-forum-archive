    <description>Hey Lenny here! I&#39;ve recently launched a new newsletter for hand-curated founders stories, startup books, podcast interviews, videos, and many more. Now you don&#39;t have an excuse to always be learning!

I know discovering good content is hard and time consuming, so I took some time to curate and put it together.

Highly appreciate it if y&#39;all can subscribe and share. Here is the link - inspireops (dot) com</description>
