    <title>Looking for a few folks to do a 15 minute usability test on our software</title>

    <description>Hi folks.  We&#39;re updating our web app in the next few days and I wanted to do a bit more usability testing on the UI.

I&#39;m happy to provide the same in return (either for your product or your website).

I&#39;m on New York time and most times between 9am and 8pm will work for me in the next few days.

This is speech therapy software. And we&#39;d do it via screen share, either Skype or Zoom.us or Teamviewer.</description>

            <p>Yep.</p>
<p>What kind of device do you want to use?<br>
What id your time zone? (or nearest major city)</p>
<p>I normally do testing on Tues-Thursday, but would be up for other times as well.</p>
