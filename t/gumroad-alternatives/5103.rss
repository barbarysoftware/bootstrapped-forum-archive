            <p>never mind spoke too soon Plasso &amp; Paddle offers pre-orders and a lot of flexibility w/ the subscription tiers! I learned the hard way it’s better to develop and test the value prop, market and biz model more so than the product these days. Thanks!</p>

            <p>For a year I haven’t had any delay with receiving my money from Gumroad. But I haven’t created any new products on their platform this year either. This thread came up on my Google results bec I just realized that Gumroad STILL doesn’t allow prices over $5K. I was about to sign up for <a href="http://trycelery.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Celery</a> but it appears they’ve been MIA - complete radio silence on twitter / facebook / email.</p>
<p>My problem is I need a checkout w/ pre-orders, quarterly and annual subscriptions features to help validate and fund my beta app.</p>
<p>The suggestions that you mentioned doesn’t appear to offer pre-orders or pre-sales.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Adam, KiteTail looks very interesting. In your marketing copy you seem to have addressed the major pain points that people encounter soon enough when they start out with a simple Stripe-only checkout process.</p>

            <p>I’m looking to release a plugin product. Don’t need many features beyond a secure download link and ideally key generation. I have a Stripe account I use for a different service I run, so I want something will use Stripe for a payment gateway without nailing me with additional transaction fees. SendOwl looks promising on all fronts for my needs.</p>

            <p>I’ve been using Gumroad for just over a year and it’s actually a really great product, but the concerns about it sort of being on life support are pretty real <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>Their iOS dashboard app stopped working last July and hasn’t worked since, tons of documentation is stale, certain pages mention features that don’t even exist anymore, etc.</p>
<p>A few months ago their webhook queues were down for 3 days before anyone there even noticed and tried to sort it out <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/pensive.png?v=5" title=":pensive:" class="emoji" alt=":pensive:"></p>
<p>It’s one of my favorite tools I pay for, but the fears of it being under-maintained have been enough to push me to start building my own tool to replace it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kitetail is still in development, but looks like it could be an interesting solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is actually what I’m working on <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blush.png?v=5" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:">  Since throwing up that landing page I’ve expanded the scope to be a more complete Gumroad competitor with first class support for downloadable products in addition to just webhooks, but haven’t put together an updated landing page yet.</p>
<p>I’m trying to build one tool that will let me run my entire info product business, which at the moment includes a book and a course. I make a full-time living from those products right now, so I’m really invested in designing and building a tool that will make it as easy as possible to continue being successful with that business.</p>
<p>Even if it doesn’t take off as a SaaS business, worst case scenario is I’ll have what I think is the best platform out there for continuing to grow and launch my training products.</p>
<p>I’m still a month or two out from inviting on any early alpha users, but if anyone is interested in learning more about it I’d love to chat.</p>
<p>I’ve been trying the Nathan-Barry-build-it-in-public thing which has been fun, can follow along with that here if you’re interested:</p>

            <p>I have been using DPD (<a href="https://getdpd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://getdpd.com/</a>) for about three years.</p>
<p>What I especially like is that their pricing is flat rate, i.e. a fixed monthly fee for a certain number of products and no revenue share.</p>
<p>They also integrate with Zapier, offer HTTP Webhhooks when purchases happen and a REST API so that you can integrate it nicely with your business processes.</p>

            <p>Looking to see if anyone will post anything positive about Gumroad.  My use case is somewhat complex and their built-in audience tools are worth the cost.  Actually, for my price point, they are substantially cheaper than Paddle which is probably my second choice.  Sendowl doesn’t yet have the functionality I need and is a little more difficult to configure at this point.</p>
<p>I’ve also emailed their support, so we’ll see how they do on Monday?</p>

            <p>Wow, I was just trying to reply to the December topic and saw this.  There are LOTS of negative reviews/experiences out there with Gumroad.  E.g. Closed accounts, money never received.  Also little public response from GR since 2015 and layoffs to boot.</p>
<p>Can anyone here who is still using Gumroad share their experience?  I’m checking out the others, but I already have been gathering a mailing list on Gumroad and don’t want to switch.  Don’t want to be pennywise and pound foolish either.  I will not be handling my own VAT stuff.</p>
