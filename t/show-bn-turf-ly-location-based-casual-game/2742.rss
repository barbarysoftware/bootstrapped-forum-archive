    <title>Show BN: Turf.ly - location-based casual game</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/show-bn-turf-ly-location-based-casual-game/2742</link>
    <description>We built Turf.ly over the last 6 months and now that we have a solid version in the iTunes App Store we&#39;re starting to promote it. I&#39;d love to hear your feedback on it. 

Tips on how to drive downloads, get press and whatever else it takes to get to 100,000 downloads would be much appreciated!</description>

            <p>We laid out our own grid that works across the globe, adapting to the curvature of the earth while keeping it simple for users to understand. The “turfs” are about the size of two football fields together.</p>
<p>So yes, it works everywhere. We’ve had quite a few Brits sign up so far. I feel like a lot of people in the UK like games for urban exploration – ties in nicely with what we’re doing.</p>

            <p>Looks interesting. Does it only work in certain cities. What about cities that aren’t laid out in a grid (pretty much every city in the UK)?</p>
