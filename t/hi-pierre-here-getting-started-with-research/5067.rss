    <title>Hi, Pierre here, getting started with research</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-pierre-here-getting-started-with-research/5067</link>
    <description>Hi everyone, my name is Pierre and I am a software developer.
I also love creating products, but I have been bitten a few times in the past by creating websites and services that don&#39;t solve a problem or connect properly with a group of people.

Right now I am actively looking for different forums and groups on the internet where I can start participating and over time understand issues in the different communities.

If you know of any great, active Facebook groups, LinkedIn groups or forums, then let me know :slight_smile:
I am still trying to figure out exactly which kind of groups I am most interested in.</description>
