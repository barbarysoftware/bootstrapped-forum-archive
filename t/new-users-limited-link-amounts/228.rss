    <title>New users limited link amounts</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/new-users-limited-link-amounts/228</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve posted this in the Introductions category description too but as an FYI new users can only post two links in their posts to prevent spamming. Stick to two to begin with if you want to update your profile with more later when you get settled and your rating/karma score rises that&#39;ll be totally fine.

Thanks!</description>
