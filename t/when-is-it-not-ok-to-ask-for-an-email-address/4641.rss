    <title>When is it not OK to ask for an email address?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/when-is-it-not-ok-to-ask-for-an-email-address/4641</link>
    <description>Yesterday I shared a video from an event I organised in July in this thread:

http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/patio11s-10-years-in-saas-talk-from-ltv-conf-2016/4636/3

We&#39;re giving away free access for a limited time, but an email address is required to gain access. Usually we charge for video from our events for a few reasons:

1) It costs money to produce the videos and we want to sustainably continue doing that for future events.
2) It costs time to package up the videos and we think they&#39;re more valuable with audio, transcripts and notes.
3) Hosting video is relatively expensive. And we don&#39;t think you should have to sit through ads to watch them.

I felt an email address would be a fair exchange for this offer. Afterall, if you&#39;re interested in one of the videos we produce you&#39;re very likely to be interested in other videos and events we produce. And so you&#39;ll likely want to hear about more.

I posted the video here because I felt it was a useful resource that you would want access to. I didn&#39;t feel comfortable only promoting our next event which requires the purchase of a ticket to attend. But it is clear that some of you feel this was boarderline spam.

So the question is what would you all prefer I and others in similar situations do in future?

Note, I&#39;ve not posted this in meta as I&#39;m interested in how this applies more broadly to forums in general.</description>

            <p>As you can see, different people value giving email/setting up an account differently.  Some find it offensive, others are shocked that some are complaining.  You can’t control how others judge it.</p>
<p>However you can make your proposition crystal clear upfront (as you did now).  This makes it clear to the prospective viewers of the video that there is a non-monetary exchange/transaction they must agree to in order to see the video.</p>

            <p>I am shocked how people are complaining about additional stuff they have to do to get the INVALUABLE information. Email address or account or Tweet or something - come on guys, people who produced video spent HOURS/DAYS of time and it cost them thousands, and you’re not willing to spend some minutes or give your email? I guess better option would be to charge like $99 instead of creating account?</p>
<p>Come on people. Let’s respect the creators. Cause we are creators too and at times we would like to collect emails too.</p>

            <p>As far as I can tell, it’s not an email that’s required, but rather creating an account. Your post was very detailed but left out this critical requirement. When I clicked through to hear what Patrick had to say in the video, I felt a bit deceived that I could only watch the video after creating an account.</p>
<p>I suggest modifying your original post to state clearly that creating a free account is required.</p>
