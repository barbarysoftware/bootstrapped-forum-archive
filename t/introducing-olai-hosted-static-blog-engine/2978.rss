    <title>Introducing Olai - Hosted Static Blog Engine</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/introducing-olai-hosted-static-blog-engine/2978</link>
    <description>Hello everyone,
I have been following the threads in this site for some product ideas. Picking up from [this thread][1], I have developed a hosted static blog engine.

I completed proof-of-concept to validate the technical feasibility of it. Before I go into fully developing it, I want to validate the business feasibility of the idea. I have put up a [landing page][2]. The idea is that you should be able to blog via mobile, desktop or web. The service (which I&#39;m calling as Olai), will generate static pages and push to S3, Github pages or even any plain old servers with FTP capability.

I appreciate any feedback on the business validity and any specific concerns that I should address.
Cheers,
Joseph

            <p>Consider adding something to the landing page which gives an idea what you will charge for it. Right now the site is very vague but in principle I like basic concept (raw post in -&gt; published post out) but I think you may also run into some hefty challenges (how do you deal with static assets for example, what about SSL, custom domains, etc).</p>
