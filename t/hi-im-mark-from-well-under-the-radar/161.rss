    <title>Hi I&#39;m Mark from... well under the radar</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-mark-from-well-under-the-radar/161</link>
    <description>I started life a machinist programming CNC machines using punched mylar tape.  Now you can guess my age.  I retired a long while ago and was ask to build a website.  Word of mouth turned into a nice little business of website development and maintenance using open source CMSs for non-profits in the area.

A couple of friends (all with day jobs) and I got together to develop a SaaS web app to help nonprofits raise money via fundraising events.  We found the code next to impossible to scale up and started looking for a PHP framework to help and found Laravel.  We have recently started rewriting the code from scratch

Anyway one of the reasons for joining the site was to look for a company that could develop another SaaS project I have in mind.  What with website to maintain and coding on the fundraising app i&#39;m strapped for time.

Thanks for the discussion board.  I&#39;ll be looking through the Intros and hopefully stumble onto one.</description>

            <p>Ha Ha Ian I was thinking the same thing.  Computerized Numerically Controlled machine. And it was an easy entry level job working in doors and no smell of hamburgers frying.</p>
<p>Yea it didn’t take long for me to move from operating ( little experience needed ) to setup and operating ( somewhat more skill needed ) to programming and setup.  Writing G code all day, setting up a machine and walking back to the nice office chair.</p>
<p>This was before Archie and Veronica.  Mozilla hadn’t been thought of yet.</p>

            <p>Well. I guess if the software thing doesn’t work out we can all get together and start a machine shop. When I was in my late teens I worked as a TIG welder building stuff out of aluminum. Funny how we came from such backgrounds and end up writing code for the web.</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>Welcome aboard. I also got my start as a CNC machinist. Right out of high school I thought being a machinist would be a cool job. After working for three companies I realized I wanted to be the one writing the code instead of just an operator. All the local machine shops are very weird here.</p>
<p>I remember we had to learn about the tape machines but never got to see one. I still remember G00 though <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile_cat.png?v=5" title=":smile_cat:" class="emoji" alt=":smile_cat:"></p>
<p>Good luck with the SAAS endeavor and be sure and post any questions.</p>

            <p>Hi Mark. Welcome the forums.</p>
<p>I ran a CNC machine for a while in my 20s as well - it cut pieces out of various metals for home-building parts. I can’t say it was fun; lots of waiting actually. Bootstrapping a software company is much more exciting, and there’s no-one to yell at you for damaging the diamond-tip drill bit.</p>
