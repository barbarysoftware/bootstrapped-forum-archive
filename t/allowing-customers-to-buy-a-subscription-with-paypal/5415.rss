    <title>Allowing customers to buy a subscription with Paypal</title>

    <description>Hey folks, 

I love Stripe but it doesn&#39;t handle Paypal :(
I&#39;d like my customers to pay with Paypal, so I am looking for payment processors that handle subscriptions where customers can pay via Paypal or credit cards. The more similar to Stripe, the better (I know it&#39;s not easy :slight_smile: )

So far Gumroad and Braintree look promising. Do you have any experience with any of those? 
I mean good or bad experiences like fast/slow in replying to tickets, handling refunds. allowing custom UI, flexibility/non flexibility with coupons, etc.

Of course I am open to suggestions about other services. 
Basically my needs are:

- handle recurring subscriptions (monthly/yearly)
- handling coupons/discounts
- transferring funds either to my bank or my Paypal
- notify me when charge is successful/failed
- manage customer trials (nice to have, not a strong requirement).

PS. I saw a similar topic has already been discussed but ~3 years ago, so maybe things have changed.</description>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/garrettdimon">@garrettdimon</a>, I’ll check it out.<br>
Not looking forward to use their APIs (with respect to Stripe’s) but it seems the best option at the moment.</p>

            <p>I’m not 100% sure of the best approach, but since Braintree is now owned by PayPal, I believe it makes it fairly easy to set up PayPal (and even Venmo). Having used Braintree for 8 years with Sifter, it’s definitely solid. I probably wouldn’t choose it over Stripe, but if you just want a secondary option to make PayPal easier to offer, then it could be worth exploring. Even after the PayPal acquisition, customer service was solid, and even when I sold Sifter, transferring account ownership was easy enough.</p>
