    <title>When is best time to send an email to new subscribers?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/when-is-best-time-to-send-an-email-to-new-subscribers/5898</link>
    <description>Hi guys,

I&#39;ve added a feature in my (desktop) app - for people to subscribe with their email address. I would like to drop a personalized email to each such subscriber to thank them, and ask them for feedback - if they have any.

When is the best time to do this: 
* ASAP
* 1-2 days later
* 1 week later
* ?

Thanks!</description>

<p>Why the delay? I don’t always run the app immediately. I don’t always start using the app heavily immediately.

<p>Got it, thanks. The feedback button I’ve added is quite visible and easy to use. Assuming the user subscribes, I will know when the user uses the app, so I guess I could time it a bit. Will need to think a bit <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>I’ve tried various approaches with timing and content. I didn’t see much difference between sending an email immediately and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>I also tried personalising the content in each email to suggest that I was an actual human writing. That didn’t seem to make much difference.</p>
<p>What made the most impact for me was keeping the email brief.</p>

            <p>People have feedback when they have something to say, not when you send them an email.</p>
<p>In other words: I have feedback about an app when I use the app and discover something that bothers me or could be improved. This could be in the first hour of use or it could be a month after I downloaded the app.</p>
<p>Why the delay? I don’t always run the app immediately. I don’t always start using the app heavily immediately. I don’t use all available functionality (especially the more advanced options) immediately. Even if something bothers me it might take 20 occurrences to bother me enough to leave feedback. Etc…</p>
<p>Instead of sending an email, make it easy for people to give you feedback about the app when they have something to say.</p>
<p>I would do it by adding a feedback button in a visible place, like in a main window of the UI.</p>
<p>That button would launch a browser with a webpage like <a href="https://blog.kowalczyk.info/contactme.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://blog.kowalczyk.info/contactme.html</a> where people can type their feedback, press a button and that will send an e-mail.</p>
