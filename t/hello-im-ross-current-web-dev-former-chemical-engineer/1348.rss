    <title>Hello, I&#39;m Ross (Current Web Dev/Former Chemical Engineer)</title>

    <description>Hi Bootstrappers.

I am a RoR developer with the company BuildingBlok (not bootstrapped) and currently working on bootstrapping my own product on the side (nothing to show yet).

I am a former Chemical and Biomolecular Engineer and also dabbled in Materials Science in grad school.  I moved on from academia and worked at Green Mountain Coffee Roasters/Keurig for a while where I developed technology for a carbonated beverage machine (you may have seen some news about this recently).  I quit about 1.5 years ago and left on very good terms.

Since then I wanted to go my own way.  I spent 7 months learning Ruby, Rails, HTML, JS to try to start my own business.  I got mired down in everything that I had to do and didn&#39;t have enough confidence in my development skills.  So I floundered with my 1st attempt.  While floundering, I talked to a friend that had a pretty mature startup (BuildingBlok) and decided to work with him to hone my development skills and build my confidence.  After 8 months I finally feel ready(ish) and am currently trying to build something on the side.  

I know I will have lots of questions and this community seemed like a great place.  I hope I can help contribute and build this community too.  So if anyone has any questions that my background could be suited for then I will happily try to help.

Cheers,
Ross</description>

            <p>Hello Ross!</p>
<p>That sounds like an interesting history. I would love to hear more about this beverage machine technology and what you’re working on now.</p>
<p>I understand being unconfident in your skills. It’s quite a problem. Especially when you spend half your time around developers and half your time around non-developers. I find myself in awe of the other developers and wonder if I can fit in, and then the non-developers are amazed that I can make a functional “Hello World!” It’s a weird rollercoaster.</p>
<p>It’s great that you’re getting the confidence to build something on your own now. Kick that Imposter Syndrome in the butt!</p>
