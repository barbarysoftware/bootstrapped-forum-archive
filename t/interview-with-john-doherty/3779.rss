    <title>Interview with John Doherty</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/interview-with-john-doherty/3779</link>
    <description>Hey guys - so I have joined #TeamYetAnotherBootstrapperInterviewPodcast with my first interview of another bootstrapper on my personal podcast:
http://podcast.kalenjordan.com/e/interview-with-john-doherty/

He&#39;s a pretty interesting guy and is at a similar stage to many people on this forum - although he&#39;s growing insanely fast (I got a tiny bit jealous not gonna lie).

Would be cool to hear what you guys think about it.</description>
