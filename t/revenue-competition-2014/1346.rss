    <title>Revenue Competition 2014</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/revenue-competition-2014/1346</link>
    <description>My friends and I each have a product (app, saas, or something online) and are trying to get them off the ground. As a sort of fun (friendly) competitive mastermind group we&#39;ve come together to compete on who can get their product launched and make the most revenue in 2014.

If you are struggling to find the modivation because you&#39;re flying solo, or just a single partner, and want to join the game to give yourself an extra edge of motivation - as well as peers to bounce ideas off of, and chat in real-time with, send me a message, I&#39;d like to send you an invite to join the crew. We&#39;re a group of developers and designers with experience in PHP (CakePHP, Laravel), Ruby (Rails, Sanatra), Javascript(Backbone, Knockout, Coffeescript), Objective-C, Photoshop, Fireworks, Illustrator, Sketch. 

Let me know if you&#39;re interested, or if you know someone that might be interested, send them my way. </description>

            <p>Great idea.</p>
<p>Some weeks ago aI was thinking about a variation on this (I was focusing on the competition side only).</p>
<p>The metric I was thinking about as a way to measure score was <strong>profit/hours worked</strong> (both in a month).</p>
<p>This way, someone that is running a business as a side project or running multiple projects at the same time can still compete with people doing one thing full time.</p>
<p>Also, I find it specially valuable that the metric rewards businesses that are being designed so that they require less time to the owner but still make money.</p>

            <p>No matter at all. Many of us do not have an app up yet. That’s the whole point. Get us moving! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"> PM me what your skillset is, and what you’re planning, and we’ll see if you fit in the group!</p>
