    <description>A neat write up by Shawn Anderson at Admin Arsenal of what he took from one conference talk and put to work in his business.

&quot;**[How I learned to love, not loathe, hiring people.][1]**&quot;

It is easy to forget that hiring is not a popularity contest, you have to judge the effectiveness of your hiring process on the number of quality hires you make, not the number of interviews. 

Any other tips?</description>

            <p>Huh? The cards get one small mention at the end, and you’re quoting the product website linked from the post, not anything in the post itself.</p>

            <p>Seems to be an ad for some scammy cards. Let me quote:</p>
<p><em>"Leadership Architect® Sort Card intellectual property license<br>
lets organizations embed competency language into existing systems,<br>
leverage familiar technology to streamline new program initiatives, and<br>
gain early buy-in for new programs. "</em></p>
<p>Wow. I feel like I just got a MBA.</p>
