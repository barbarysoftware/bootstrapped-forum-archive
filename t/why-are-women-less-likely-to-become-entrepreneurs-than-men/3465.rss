<p>I think Amy’s pretty cool. I do, however, disagree with the hard position the article takes. Women and men are different biologically. We are also different in the way society cultivates us. What she writes is true for both sexes. However, it doesn’t underwhelm the realities that do exist for women.</p>

<p>I’m about to break one of my very own rules: Don’t write for women.  I’m a woman. I write about business. Why not write about business for women? Beca</p>
