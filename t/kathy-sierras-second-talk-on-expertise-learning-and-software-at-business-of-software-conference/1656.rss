    <title>Kathy Sierra&#39;s second talk on expertise, learning and software at Business of Software Conference</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/kathy-sierras-second-talk-on-expertise-learning-and-software-at-business-of-software-conference/1656</link>
    <description>Kathy Sierra came back to Business of Software Conference in 2013 with a deeper dive into the art of building awesome users. If you have seen Kathy’s 2012 Business of Software Conference Talk, ‘Building the Minimum Badass User“, you won’t need persuading about Kathy’s gifts as a communicator, teacher and provocateur. 

The second talk builds on this and stands on its own but the two talks make a very nice pair.
