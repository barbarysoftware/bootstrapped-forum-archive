    <title>B2C tech support service &amp; &quot;Fix My Googles&quot;</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/b2c-tech-support-service-fix-my-googles/2607</link>
    <description>I am used to being tech support for my family but now that a neighbour that I&#39;ve barely ever talked to is asking me to help &quot;fix my googles&quot; enough is enough.

**Can anyone recommend a remote tech support service I can refer them to?**

Was also wondering if this would be a good model for something similar to WPCurve&#39;s? (Monthly subscription for small remote tech support jobs).
 
*(I&#39;ve no intention of doing this - I get enough MS induced rage just keeping my own PC&#39;s working).*</description>

            <p>There are companies such as <a href="http://www.myphonesupport.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.myphonesupport.com</a> which have a number to call for support.  Pricing seems problematic, though.  Perhaps there’s a local to you business which does house calls.</p>
<p>You could take the tech support as an opportunity to learn more about how people uncomfortable with computers interact with them and let that inform how you design/explain your software.</p>
