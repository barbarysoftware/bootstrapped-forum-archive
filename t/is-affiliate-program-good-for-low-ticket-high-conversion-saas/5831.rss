    <description>Hey Bootstrappers,

Just to set the context, I am maker of design tool - Visual Inspector - built for non-coders to make changes in live websites (for visualizing new ideas or fixing design bugs.)

As of now, we run a low-ticket ($5 per month or $49 one-time) plan which has a good 10% &quot;visit &gt; Paid user&quot; conversion, we have acquired over 1,000 customers in 4 months mostly freelance web developers or early stage agencies.

**Wondering if affiliate is a good marketing channel to explore paid growth in this category?** 

If yes, can someone help us understand more about setting it up, tools etc? May be @SteveMcLeod or @Virgil could help.

Thanks in advance for your help and suggestions!!

            <p>High converting products are ideal for affiliate marketing, as it encourages them to keep going and try harder.</p>
<p>The biggest downside for affiliates is when it doesn’t seem worth the bother or effort because they get zero sales. If they’re getting <em>anything</em> then they tend to stick with it a lot better.</p>
<p>If you’re charging per month, will you be paying affiliates on an ongoing basis as well?</p>

<p>Do you have a good relationship with a few influencers which have a strong audience in your niche?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you willing to do 2-4 webinars/month with top bloggers or consultants in your industry?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you aproximate how many of your customers have an audience of potential clients for you?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Getting a positive ROI for the affiliate program is not hard, you need 1 good affiliate and it will pay for the aff tracker and probably a few hours you put/month(most companies don’t put much effort at first). However, if you want to make it as a powerful channel, you need to put more effort into it(mostly on recruiting) + you need a solid funnel(with decent conversion rate) and product in place.</p>
<p>It’s not really necessary to have tons of sales to make this channel work, I have lots of companies who launched with the help of affiliates and they get 50% of the sales just from this channel, but having a solid flow of sales usually means you have a solid product and funnel set up, which helps getting high quality affiliates and keeping them.</p>

            <p>My view: don’t run an affiliate program until you already have a solid amount of monthly sales. It is time-consuming to run an affiliate program, and when your total sales are low, the affiliate program simply won’t return enough sales.</p>
<p>It is hard to get good affiliates to work with you; typically when your sales are low, you won’t get any decent affiliates.</p>
