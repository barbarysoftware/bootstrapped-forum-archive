    <title>How are you acquiring customers?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-are-you-acquiring-customers/31</link>
    <description>I think it would be neat if people shared how they acquire customers. 

We have been an web first company for a while now. Mobile has always been a second thought. Over the course of this last year we have noticed a big shift. 60% of our new customers come in via the app store. This time last year less than 5% of our new customers were from the app store. We have not had a strong focus on mobile either. 

Our online marketing (ie. google adwords) are not performing well as it did in the past. 

We still get a fair amount of traffic from social, and SEO but our conversions have gone done. I think less and less of our possible customers are spending time on their desktops. 

As a company we are rethinking our marketing efforts.

It would be interesting for others to share how they are acquiring customers. What is working? What is not? </description>

            <p>I’m curious if, assuming you get primarily search traffic, how well do you get new newsletter sign-ups?</p>
<p>Any ball park as to microsite landing to conversions?</p>

            <p>My little ebook operates almost 100% on content marketing through blog posts.</p>
<p>As for word of mouth – hard to say.  More specifically, it can be very hard to measure.  I can’t find many reviews of my book (Rebuilding Rails) and it’s only mentioned on a few web pages.  But I keep talking to people who say things like, “oh, in the Ruby Users Group I was just in, nearly every single person took out their laptop at some point, pointed to your page and said, ‘do you know if this is any good?’.”</p>
<p>And I have enough sales and enough occasional tweets and enough web mentions that there’s at least a bit of “yes, it’s good” background noise.</p>
<p>Though Google’s big recommendations for searching on “rebuilding rails” are “rebuilding rails pdf” and “rebuilding rails download.”  So I may just be underestimating pirate activity <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I used to think the same thing early on in the business, it’s very wrong. There’s no such thing as pure organic growth even if you built the most amazing thing. Now, another “problem” is that there are people arround that are experts at selling crappy/good enough stuff to a lot of people and if you focus too much on the product they might steal your lunch money <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I’d love to hear more about partners and affiliate marketing and distribution channels.</p>
<p>One thing that really intrigues me about marketing, is that once you find good channels, you’ve basically invented a money pump. As long as LTV &gt; CTA, you have a money machine.</p>
<p>I used to think that if you had to advertise your product to sell it, your product sucked. That’s a narrow minded mentality that leaves a lot of customers and money on the table.</p>

            <p>What we have been doing lately with Frettie, is focussing heavily on partnerships and creating a strong backer/following of our idea and product. We are more interested in growing from word of mouth, primarily because we need to develop that relationship with our audience. It is a small target, so it requires real focussed marketing. It has been working really great so far for us, because it is also positioning us a major player in that landscape. With Frettie, we also have a ton of ways we can engage deeper than just Ads. Things that we have been doing are: Chat Rooms, Sponsoring of Events, Minor Ad spending in newsletters, Interviews and a Blog. With that said, this may not work for all cases.</p>

            <p>We’ve had success with making tiny apps that are focused on specific communities that we want to target with bigger apps. For instance, when we launched Are My Sites Up (website monitoring) we also launched a web app that let people get instant up/down results for any website (kind of a precursor to Down For Everyone Or Just Me). That got us a lot of traffic from people who were interested in a product like ours, and it was easy to sell them on it. Also in this realm: Tada List from 37signals -&gt; Basecamp.</p>

<p>We have done a great deal of “comment marketing” and it works out pretty darn well. We never set out and have comment marketing campaigns. Just when we read something that we like or we have something to contribute we just take the extra time and leave a thoughtful comment.</p>
<p>You do not see the results overnight but when I check in on our web stats over 6 months or so comments lead to a fair amount of traffic. Just a little bit everyday.</p>

            <p>For us (<a href="http://www.kickofflabs.com" rel="nofollow noopener">KickoffLabs</a>) the lesson we learned early was to engage with (potential) customers on existing own sites and communities.</p>
<p>Too many startups focus on direct advertising and writing blog posts (we we did as well).  They forget to add comments to relevant blog posts, other Facebook pages, etc (for us the biggest honeypot of customers has been quora).</p>
<p>Long term, this may not directly scale, but the added benefit is it will yield new customers month after month because of the long term Google effect.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>In this post I’ve seen a few comments about relying upon word of mouth. I always look at the whole “word of mouth” vs. paid advertising from this angle: If your product isn’t growing by word of mouth, even by a teeny bit, then it might not be worth talking about, and therefore not really even be worth paying to market. However, once you are gaining at least some growth by word of mouth, your quest is to find the right tool to act as a catalyst to that growth, and it will be different for every product. Like <a class="mention" href="/u/andyjohnson">@andyjohnson</a> mentioned above, LinkedIn worked great for his (our) app for a while, I know others that have great return from Facebook, and others who live by Google Adwords. Some businesses will experience great results from hiring salespeople, purchasing booths at tradeshows, or sponsoring conferences. Some people throw conferences, speak at conferences, of just wear the same t-shirt for days promoting your product while attending a conference. In my experience, the time taken to write blog posts on certain subjects has always surprised me in the traffic it can generate when you strike a hot topic.</p>
<p>Speaking of blogs, these days I’ve been gleaning a lot of great guerilla marketing wisdom from the Neil Patel’s Quick Sprout blog (<a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.quicksprout.com/</a>).</p>

            <p>We use LinkedIn ads for one of our properties and saw immediate results. The nice thing about LinkedIn is you can get very specific with what audience you target.</p>
<p>For example, you might want to target only managers who work in the staffing &amp; recruiting departments of online media companies in North America. LinkedIn will then display exactly how many members in the network fit that description, allow you to set your CPC, and daily budget.</p>
<p>But we have hit some really dry spells with LinkedIn too. Sometimes our impressions go from thousands down to almost nothing. Very inconsistent. Probably depends a lot on when your target audience is actually hanging out on LinkedIn.</p>

            <p>I talked to a fellow last night who gets huge results on Facebook as they can target very specifically for B2C. I guess if you’re B2C and have a specific niche it might make sense to give that a serious look (as icky as it may feel) since you can target very specifically to people who have attended certain events, gone certain places, etc.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the link <a class="mention" href="/u/earthlingworks">@earthlingworks</a> (aka - Ruben) - just what I was looking for.</p>
<p>I would also like to hear of anyone having success with Linked In, Facebook Ads, Stumble Upon - or really any other paid traffic source.  I am planning on trying as many of these as I can over the next couple of months to see what sticks.</p>

            <p>When you don’t know where the heck these people came from they go in the word of mouth bucket <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<p>All of those tips are great, but that link is gold. Hadn’t seen that before.</p>

            <p>Interesting how word of mouth is such a big source for everyone. It’s never really been a big (measurable) source for me.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m mostly getting customers through:</p>
<p><strong>SEO</strong> - Blog posts focused on specific keywords, and resources (like templates) that potential customers are searching for. My main SEO strategy is indirect phrases like <em>web design proposal templates</em> and <em>freelance marketing</em> vs direct <em>proposal software</em>. Though, nowadays I’m ranking well for most of both kinds. Going after long tail keywords has also worked well.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution deals &amp; integrations</strong> - Basically, links from being listed on add-on pages, partner pages, or doing cross promotion deals. You can find lots of ideas for that here: <a href="http://moz.com/blog/how-to-grow-21-tactics-to-acquire-customers" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moz.com/blog/how-to-grow-21-tactics-to-acquire-customers</a></p>
<p><strong>Content + email marketing</strong> - This has been nice in accelerating growth a bit. Being aggressive with capturing emails from pages that get the most traffic, has helped. I hired three writers that already know how to get traffic (and create shareable content), use my email list to help kick things off, and sometimes do special experiments (like infographics). This has been the hardest of the three, but it has totally been worth it.</p>

            <p>Following up on my previous post…it turns out that if you put a “not accepting new clients” message on your website for 2 years, word-of-mouth referrals fall off significantly.  Who woulda thunkit?</p>

            <p>I too have had some success with micro-sites. Well, calling them micro-sites is a bit generous. They’re more like landing pages with their own domains. Here are two of five: <a href="http://lispjobs.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://lispjobs.com/</a> and <a href="http://erlangjobs.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://erlangjobs.com/</a>.</p>
<p>The micro-sites do exactly what I had hoped: rank extremely well for the intended keywords (“lisp jobs” and “erlang jobs” respectively), and drive traffic to my main site. By keeping them as simple as possible it really helped to keep the required investment low.</p>
<p>Also, Twitter has always been a strong source of traffic for my job board. One day I would like to try sponsoring functional programming related tech conferences, but I don’t have the budget for it at the moment.</p>
<p>The key is figuring out where your target audience hangs out (either online or offline, but I think most of us would prefer online) or where they will go to search for your product/solution. For example, I know that functional programmers love to participate on FP related mailing lists, and I’ve had success reaching out to them there.</p>

            <p>I’m in a strange situation where I want to give a feel of the mom &amp; pop intimacy while still having the trust of a larger SaaS (non-profits are very risk averse and like the comfort of stability).</p>
<p>In face-to-face meetings I make it clear to clients that they have my direct line and I want to give some of that feel to the general copy in my general marketing as well.</p>
<p>Right now, one of my problems has been being scared of not having a big pool of traffic or leads right now so I’m a bit risk adverse of trying to much change in message, etc.</p>
