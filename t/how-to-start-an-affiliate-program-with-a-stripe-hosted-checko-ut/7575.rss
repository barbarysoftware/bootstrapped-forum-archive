    <title>How to start an affiliate program with a Stripe hosted checkout?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-to-start-an-affiliate-program-with-a-stripe-hosted-checko-ut/7575</link>
    <description>Our checkout at Content Koala is a very simple Stripe hosted checkout.

Our business could really benefit from an affiliate program. However, I can only find a way to do this for WooCommerce or full Stripe integration via partners. No simple way of doing it for a hosted Stripe Checkout.

I am guessing that there may be a solution that involves unique link generation and simply tracking those via my Google Analytics?

But if any of you have an elegant solution that would be great :slight_smile:  

Thanks!</description>
