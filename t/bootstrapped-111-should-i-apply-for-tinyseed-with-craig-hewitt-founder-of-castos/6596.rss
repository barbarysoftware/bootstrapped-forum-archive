            <p>As another followup:  Craig mentioned that TinySeed takes only US companies.  He then talked about Stripe Atlas as a way to have US company.  I’d be very careful using Stripe Atlas because some EU countries act like this (Germany is just an example, France might be different):<br>
When you enter Stripe Atlas there are tax and administration implications. If you live in Germany and operate your company from Germany, the German tax authorities can/will assume that you in effect run a company under German tax jurisdiction. The effect is that you have to file tax as if you had a German company, and you have the US company tax things going on. This is compounded by VAT complications, as your US company is responsible for EU/German VAT.<br>
Then there is also the issue with health insurance contributions in Germany, not sure how that would be handled for a US company director living and working in Germany.</p>
<p>Probably getting all this right with a German accountant will cost $$, plus yearly $$ fees and US accounting fees.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/stevemcleod">@SteveMcLeod</a> , great interview again!</p>
<p>As a followup to Craig mentioning Eugene Schwarz’s book, I think the book is mainly geared to products related to consumers.</p>
<p>A much better book for SaaS is in my view:  “Roadmap to revenue” by K. Zhivago.  She concentrates more on the buying process, as opposed to buyer personas.</p>
