    <title>What is your biggest issue with billing?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/what-is-your-biggest-issue-with-billing/2964</link>
    <description>I&#39;m doing a small research about how startups and bootstrappers are handling their billing, above all when they have to work with different payment methods and/or calculate taxes (specially the VAT nightmare). How&#39;s your experience? What are your biggest problems? Thanks!!</description>
