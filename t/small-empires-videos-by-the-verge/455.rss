    <title>Small Empires videos by The Verge</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/small-empires-videos-by-the-verge/455</link>
    <description>The Verge has been releasing a video series called &quot;Small Empires&quot; on Youtube the last couple of weeks. In it Alexis Ohanian, one of the Reddit founders, visits a couple of startups in New York that have all built their own little empire. It&#39;s not completely focused on Bootstrapping (so far I believe 2 out of 4), but also not promoting / idealising the idea of outside money. It actually takes quite a nice personal approach and I really did enjoy watching them. Hopefully it&#39;s inspirational for others too :smile:

Below is the latest episode. Youtube should help you find the rest.
