    <title>Helping developers / bootstrappers from disadvantaged backgrounds</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/helping-developers-bootstrappers-from-disadvantaged-backgrounds/3744</link>
    <description>Hey guys - been starting to kick around an idea and wanted to get some feedback here.

I&#39;m thinking of building some kind of platform / network / business model / mentorship network / or something to help either developers or bootstrappers (or both) that come from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Likely that means people in developing countries that wouldn&#39;t otherwise have access to many opportunities.

I found a great example of this - http://www.andela.com/ - what they do specifically is that they find really smart people in Lagos, Nigeria and train them to be developers and their business model is that they&#39;re basically a staffing company.  They seem to be doing amazingly well and doing really awesome work in Nigeria.

That seems like a model that could definitely work in other places (I&#39;m thinking probably latin america as my wife and I both speak spanish).

But I&#39;m also thinking it would be cool to have some kind of a bootstrapper angle on it.  Help people to bootstrap their own businesses.  I&#39;m not sure how realistic that is since the barrier to entry to bootstrap a business can be pretty flippin hard as compared to getting a job as a developer.

Would appreciate any thoughts, references, or feedback!</description>

            <p>Thanks man <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Yeah I will eventually want to hone in on some initially pretty small and simple goals.  I’m thinking that if I go the teaching business route (and not the getting people jobs route), maybe I focus on helping people start ecommerce stores.  So basically I would try to be the ecommerce fuel for new stores in latin america.</p>
<p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/petersuhm">@petersuhm</a> - maybe we can chat about it on our call tomorrow <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slightly_smiling.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling:"></p>

            <p>I like the idea and would love to help out! I’ve lived in Morocco as a student and in South East Asia… I know a lot of talented people all those places! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slightly_smiling.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling:"></p>

            <p>You should totally do it. But I’d start smaller. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slightly_smiling.png?v=5" title=":slightly_smiling:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling:"></p>
