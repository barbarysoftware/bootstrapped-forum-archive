    <description>Hey all,

About a week ago I received an e-mail from Amy Hoy advising that they&#39;re holding BaconBizConf on the 28th/29th May in Philadelphia. Anybody been before? Would love to hear how you got on with it as I&#39;m seriously considering attending this year. It would be great to hear from people who have attended previous years.

Cheers
