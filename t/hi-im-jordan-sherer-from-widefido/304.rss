    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Jordan Sherer from Widefido</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-jordan-sherer-from-widefido/304</link>
    <description>Howdy!

I&#39;m Jordan Sherer, founder of [Widefido](http://widefido.com/about/). I have been bootstrapping Widefido on the side since 2007, having created TodoPaper and [MnmlRdr](https://mnmlrdr.com/) during this time. It&#39;s been a long road, but this past February I said goodbye to my &quot;real job&quot; and was able to shift to working on Widefido full-time. What an experience!

The Business of Software forums was a primary inspiration and sounding board for me when I was starting my business. The things I learned there helped me immensely along the way. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing where this forum goes and cannot wait to pitch-in and give back. 

Props to @ian and @andrey for making this happen.

Best,
Jordan
