    <title>Saying Hi, this is me from the UK</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/saying-hi-this-is-me-from-the-uk/4024</link>
    <description>Hi all,

I&#39;m new to the forums and boostrapping.  I&#39;m a Web Developer by trade (since mid 90&#39;s PHP 3 OMG!!) and a DB developer / DBA before that (Oracle, IBM DB2 SQL).

Before being in business full time (1998) I did things on the side such as articles for magazines, add on products (plugins) etc mainly for the now almost dead DataEase desktop DB software.

I&#39;ve just cashed in my shares of a small company (11 staff) that i was part owner and Director of.  It&#39;s a Digital Agency (web/digital dev, design and consultancy).  I&#39;ve stayed on as a developer but am looking at maybe bootstrapping a side project in the future. (My business was/is Digital Marmalade if anyone is interested)

I guess the entrepreneur is a strong driving force in me and I&#39;ve started to look at the current, modern landscape of the bootstrapper in 2016.

Currently working my way through 100&#39;s of hours of missed podcasts, I&#39;m on ep 21 of bootstrapped.fm and laracasts videos. 
Outside of software I&#39;m recovering from shoulder surgery and hoping to get back to competitive Archery in the next couple of months.

thanks for taking time out to read this
