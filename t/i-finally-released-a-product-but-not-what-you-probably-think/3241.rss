    <title>I finally released a product (but not what you probably think)</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/i-finally-released-a-product-but-not-what-you-probably-think/3241</link>
    <description>Hey all!

So, that whole SmallSpec thing I was struggling to launch for so long?  I saw an opportunity to take a detour and launch something small, fast, so I did it.

As part of the Gumroad Small Product Lab 10-day challenge, I wrote a book.  A book about *drumroll please* ...podcasting.  Obvious choice, right?

If you&#39;re interested, it&#39;s at [www.record-and-release.com][1], but I&#39;m not here to sell.  I&#39;m here to talk about how INCREDIBLY RELIEVING it is to finally, finally, finally have some kind of a product out in the wild, even if it&#39;s not the product I was hoping to launch.  Just knowing that I&#39;m &quot;on the scoreboard&quot; has injected a much-needed sense of optimism back into me.

For a long time, I was stuck.  I thought I didn&#39;t know enough to launch anything.  But that was horseshit, I was just engaging in Condition X thinking.  &quot;When I learn enough about landing pages...&quot;, &#39;When I learn enough about lead magnets...&quot;, &quot;When I master e-mail autoresponders...&quot;, that sort of thinking.

And to be honest, I was getting depressed.  You probably already know I fell into a deep depression, had a minor breakdown, and destroyed my SmallSpec prototype just over a year ago.  Yeah, that wasn&#39;t my finest moment, and since then - even though I&#39;ve since re-created a SmallSpec prototype - I really hadn&#39;t marched that much closer to launching anything.

I&#39;m not sure why this 10-day product challenge fired me up so.  Maybe because I was already outlining a 5-day e-mail course on something related to freelancing, so my writing muscles were all warmed up?  Maybe because I had been considering an ebook anyway?  Maybe the oft-repeated advice that &quot;you shouldn&#39;t do a Saas app to start out, you should do a small product&quot; finally sunk in?  Maybe it was the support of the Product People Club?  I really don&#39;t know.

All I know is that at a certain point, I just gave myself permission to move forward.  I decided that everything I knew about marketing a product - which, it turns out, is quite a bit - was good enough, and proceeded as though I knew everything.

Anyway.  It&#39;s been a long, weird trip to get here.  I&#39;m a little stressed about the dollars and cents of it - this book is NEVER going to earn out the $5,000 in otherwise-billable time I put into creating it.  There&#39;s just no way.  But it pays off in other ways:

1) By publishing this, I have added &quot;...and author of...&quot; to my professional bio, forever. Nobody can take that back. 
2) There&#39;s a call for consulting built in to the book, so there may be some back-end revenue coming that way.  I suppose that might let the book earn out, even if the sale price doesn&#39;t.
3) I&#39;m on the scoreboard, and I know it.
4) I can re-purpose the content from the book in other ways, some more lucrative than others.

So here I am, with a $29 ($20 on launch day) ebook for sale, 3 pre-orders in my pocket, feeling like I&#39;m on top of the world.  It&#39;s not where I anticipated being, and it&#39;s not where I *wanted* to be, but it&#39;s good to be here nonetheless.  There&#39;s a lesson in here someplace about expectations, control, and acceptance.

Next up: whip SmallSpec into shape and **make**. **It**. **Happen**.  That shit has been dragging on for way, way too long.

Just wanted to share, since I&#39;ve been such an infrequent visitor here lately.  Feel free to ask questions about my subject matter, my process, etc.  Whatever you feel might help you get unstuck and get a product out the door, too, ask away!

            <p>Congratulations. I had the same feeling when I launched Sviking. Not a great product, but I just wanted a push to get it out and I did. 100 or so installs but worth it. Fantastic feeling.</p>

            <p>My next big thing is: continuing to push on my current thing!  I suppose I could tie that to Amys’ September challenge, but I’m already in motion with my plans.</p>
<p>I have audio &amp; kindle versions of the book on deck.  I just about have details finished on done-for-you productized consulting for podcasters.  I’m creating some video content.  Next I need to bundle stuff up into tiers and start doing “real” marketing, outside the confines of my existing audience.  Probably going to try FB ads first.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I have a next thing.  But it’s an extension of the current thing!  I’m convinced that - marketed correctly - this podcasting product has legs.  Maybe not life-changing legs, but “put some money in my pocket and help me upgrade my primitive-ass marketing skills” legs.  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>Than you Shantnu! If only there was true marketing magic, that’d be a bestselling piece of SaaS <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> Whenever people have to take any action, a conversion rate applies (dividing the number by twenty, optimistically). We’re passive lurkers by nature.</p>
<p>One of the latest books I read is <a href="http://thebrainaudit.com" rel="nofollow noopener">The Brain Audit</a> by Sean d’Souza and I swear by his principles why customers actually buy!</p>

            <p>Jane, some great advice there. Especially the part about doing a lot of promotion doesn’t mean a lot of sales, but no promotion <em>will</em> mean poor sales.</p>
<p>You can break your back on promotion, and get pennies in return. Marketing is hard, man.</p>
<p>If someone has any marketing snake oil, I’d be happy to buy. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

            <p>Jane!  I read that article already - in fact, your admonition to “practice marketing in your own sandbox” is what led me to get more serious about using my own podcast as a guinea-pig for learning how to market w/email.</p>

            <p>Congrats Christopher! I’m so with you on your small beginning to the greater things. I did a very similar thing in 2013, and I never regretted devoting the time to a book (here’s <a href="http://uibreakfast.com/zero-sales/" rel="nofollow noopener">an encouraging post-mortem</a>). It’s a stepping stone to your authority, as you mentioned <span class="hashtag">#1</span>!</p>
<p>Make sure to run a deal or even a few on your book, it’ll bring a lot of exposure and some extra cash.</p>
<p>Good luck with SmallSpec!</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/christopher">@Christopher</a> I can relate to your excitement over shipping! Like you, I have been working on a project with a large scope and with time I just lost momentum. The list of things left to do felt overwhelming, having to juggle that with freelance work was difficult.</p>
<p>About a month ago, I put the project on pause and decided to execute on a much smaller idea. I haven’t been happier working on a side project in a long, long time. There’s liberation in moving quickly, having a shorter roadmap, seeing the shipping date moving closer and closer each day.</p>
<p>I personally try to optimize for happiness as opposed to money. Yes, making income from my own projects is a part of what makes me happy, but I am not making decisions solely on the amount of income. At this point I make more freelancing, but oh boy does it make me miserable. My advice is to not add Vlad to a list of haters, but rather realize that he was likely coming from a different perspective and value set, and that’s okay. His argument is logical if you try to optimize solely for earnings.</p>
<p>There’s value in training your brain to think of yourself as a person that ships things. With each product released, no matter how small, you will add to your confidence, train your “shipping” muscles, and bring yourself closer to the SmallSpec launch, if this is still what you want to do.</p>
<p>Good luck and congrats.</p>

            <p>Christopher got 2 consulting leads without even trying. That’s worth $$$ as he can always let others do the actual work later if this stream of leads expands further. And if there are patterns in the leads it’s an opportunity for productized consulting.</p>
<p>There’s just so much more to an asset (like a book or app) than just the money it brings. Also, with proper marketing this book can do much more than 3K lifetime.</p>

</aside>
<p>Let’s be practical about this and evaluate the outcomes.</p>
<p>You say that this is a path to <em>non-consulting revenue</em>. Then we should dismiss those <em>2 requests for podcast consulting</em>. Makes sense? Because consulting, podcast-related or not, cannot bring money while you sleep.</p>
<p>Then we have two positiive things left:</p>
<ul>
<li>$600 in direct sales</li>
<li>An audience of people interested in creating podcasts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Direct Sales</strong></p>
<p>$600 are $600. Let’s assume it grows to $3000 over the book lifetime. That would be roughly a half-week of consulting vs, I believe, 10(?) days it took to write a book.</p>
<p>If the numbers above are correct, it is not practical to try and build a number of small products to replace the consulting income. The investment (lost opportunity) is actually bigger than the profits.</p>
<p><strong>New Audience</strong></p>
<p>The number of people who wants to start podcasts, I believe, if rather small. It is a hard work, and most people understand that. I might be wrong, of course, but it seems that the podcast movement is close to its saturation point.</p>
<p>The audience is also not directly overlapping with the primary product, SmallSpec, so it doesn’t help that product.</p>
<p>The only way that new audience could be useful, I believe, if, instead of SmallSpec, you make a new product for podcast authors.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Well, gee, I sure am glad it’s “fine” with you.  Just last night, I was unable to sleep, consumed with thoughts of “I’m so happy to finally have a product out the door, but…oh, man, <em>what will Vlad thing of this</em>?!?”</p>
<p>Come ON, dude.  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>
<p>My goal with SmallSpec was to diversify away from my revenue being 100% dependent upon the “work an hour, bill an hour” consulting model - hell, that’s the goal of pretty much <em>every</em> consultant who wants to do a product, and it’s understandable.</p>
<p>SmallSpec began to drag, badly.  I’m glad I had the good sense to change tack and attack that goal from another angle, instead of behaving as though I were somehow obligated to do SmallSpec and nothing but SmallSpec, simply because that’s the first product I announced.  I suspect that this is where a lot of aspiring founders struggle; I was certainly circling that particular drain for a long while.</p>
<p>So, what you refer to as “a waste of time and a creative way to procrastinate”, I refer to as “a more immediate and direct path toward my stated goal”.  Temporarily shifting my energies to launch <a href="http://www.record-and-release.com" rel="nofollow noopener">RECORD &amp; RELEASE</a> is the <em>precise opposite</em> of procrastination &amp; wasting time; it is an investment of time in a more expedient path to recurring non-consulting revenue.</p>
<p>The product - be it software, a book, or anything else - is not the goal; the product exists only <em>in service of</em> the goal.  Otherwise, the product is useless.</p>
<p>I’m officially putting you in my journal as my first hater.  Congratulations!  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/innocent.png?v=5" title=":innocent:" class="emoji" alt=":innocent:"></p>

            <p>At first my thinking was:</p>
<p>“Why he’s so happy about that? He’s slow with his main product, and now he took even more time to release something that is not even helping him to reach out to the prospects of the SmallSpec. What a waste of time and a creative way to procrastinate!”.</p>
<p>But if it is to overcome a writer’s block, I guess it is fine.</p>
