Just listened to the episode by the way.</p>
<p>Its certainly that great little SaaS that has oodles of potential if you can find a couple of niches to push it into. To be honest we almost used it at Campaign Monitor for bug bashes. I just couldnt get the company credit card to do it.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It is a good question. The “earn back” timeframe is highly dependent on whether I can get Saber Feedback growing again.</p>
<p>I didn’t state it explicitly in the podcast episode, but for a while at least I’m investing all the earnings from Saber Feedback back into making it better. For the next few months, that will be almost solely on rescuing the marketing.</p>
<p>If I didn’t already have another product, and hence an income stream, then perhaps I’d be more cautious and work alone on Saber Feedback to reduce expenses.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/stevemcleod">@SteveMcLeod</a> Thanks for this episode.  Really interesting.  I’m a bit puzzled about your valuation of sabrefeedback.<br>
If I understand correctly, the purchase price was about:<br>
<code>purchase price = (MRR - hosting etc.) * 36</code><br>
I think this is a fair valuation for a SaaS which one bootstrapper runs.<br>
However in the podcast, you mention that you won’t do much work, and let other people handle most work on sabrefeedback.  that means you have to pay these other people.<br>
So, in my mind, the valuation for you  looks different than the above one:<br>
<code>purchase price = (MRR - hosting etc. - people cost) * X</code><br>
with <code>X</code> unknown (at least for us).  This <code>X</code> will be much larger than 36.<br>
Given that there is reasonable MRR, the cash flow looks like no problem, but I was wondering about the time frame you have to “earn back” the principal.</p>
<p>The issue I try to raise is that the valuation of a business can be substantially different, depending on how you look at it.</p>
