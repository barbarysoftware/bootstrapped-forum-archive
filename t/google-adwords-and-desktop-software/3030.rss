    <title>Google Adwords and Desktop Software</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/google-adwords-and-desktop-software/3030</link>
    <description>I must have missed the memo but Google has changed their Adwords policies regarding desktop software and free trial versions.  I&#39;ve been doing a dance with them for nearly two weeks now trying to comply with their new policies and my Adwords account is currently suspended for reasons unknown.  Anyway, a heads up and here&#39;s the policies in question:

Policy violation: Unwanted software
Details &amp; instructions: https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/50423?hl=en

Policy violation: Unsupported content - Free desktop software
Details &amp; instructions: https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/6023676?hl=en#354</description>

            <p>I’ve sent them a request to review my web site, but 2 weeks passed already and still no response. Yet they continue to send me “Get Adwords another chance” email in which they give me $30 for advertising - the money I can’t spend as my account is suspended <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I don’t use Adwords since April, and I’m starting to think I don’t need it too much.</p>
<p>I’m surprised as to why they don’t like my web site? There’s no malware or “unwanted software” and it’s been around for a decade (the web site is <a href="http://www.djsoft.net" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.djsoft.net</a> by the way), the niche software is in is not some questionable like “remote control” or “system optimization” - I don’t like being considered like a scammer.</p>
<p>There are lots of deceptive ads from Google that try to trick users to download some crapware, but when I want to advertise my sofware I hit all sorts of barriers and they consider it as “unwanted”.</p>
<p>Google is in urgent need of a good competition. Especially if the new rule about “one web site for one target country” is true. What are the good advertising alternatives I should try? Bing?</p>

            <p>Adwords continues to surprise me. I was told by their customer support that they are preparing new advertising rules: for each targeted country, you have to have a separate domain. I asked to be made sure, if that means I can’t have my English web site target England, Australia, US - they told me, that no. I have to have a web site, on a separate domain, for each country. Can someone contact them and verify? I hope that I was talking with someone who interpreted the rules incorrectly, as it’s a complete absurd.</p>

<p>I am now getting nearly as many clicks from Bing Ads as AdWords.</p>
<p>Bing Ads is a shameless rip-off of AdWords, so if you know AdWords there isn’t really anything new to learn.</p>
<p>Its actually really easy to import your Adwords campaign into Bing Adcenter. I did it a few days ago for a campaign. Took a few minutes. Although you have to give Microsoft temporary control over your Adwords account to do it!</p>

            <p>This is so frustrating.  If you have paid software, but have a free trial, you get lumped in with the questionable software Google is trying to weed out.  You then have to use your very precious and short ad space to show your product name, which for most new customers is meaningless since they don’t know you yet.  So now our ads cost the same but have less selling power.  I’m a bit miffed…    Oh how I wish a decent AdWords competitor would show up!</p>

            <p>I resolved my issues after a few days.  Turns out having a free version is more of a problem with Google than I realised.  It requires registration with Google as the author of the software and requires the product name to be included in all Adwords ads.  Probably the most distressing part of the whole experience is the whole bureaucracy that Google seems to have built up around these processes, how unwieldy it seems, and how little power the people you actually speak to on the phone have.  In comparison it made calling the Australian Tax Office seem like an exercise in business process efficiency.</p>

            <p>Not desktop software but kind of related - I got my Adwords ad suspended because it was linking to a “Coming soon, sign-up for early access” type website even though this was mentioned in the ad itself. According to the rep I was talking to the website needs to provide a finished product that a user can download or buy. I generally didn’t find Google/Facebook/Twitter ads very effective in getting people to join a pre-launch mailing list.</p>

            <p>I must have missed the memo but Google has changed their Adwords policies regarding desktop software and free trial versions.  I’ve been doing a dance with them for nearly two weeks now trying to comply with their new policies and my Adwords account is currently suspended for reasons unknown.  Anyway, a heads up and here’s the policies in question:</p>
<p>Policy violation: Unwanted software<br>
