    <title>What would you do (handling a payment dispute)?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/what-would-you-do-handling-a-payment-dispute/5316</link>
    <description>It&#39;s been a long day, but I wanted to bring up a situation which arose today and see where you all stand on it. Maybe  it&#39;ll make me feel better to get it off my chest, so here goes:

Today I received a payment dispute for a domain that was auto-renewed. The dispute, if it succeeds, means my company is out the cost of the domain (it&#39;s a .io domain, so the wholesale price is $39.50 and we charge $40, basically no margin) plus the chargeback fee ($15). The customer in question filed the dispute as &quot;Unrecognized charge&quot;. I emailed the customer and said that I assumed it was a mistake, explained what the charge was for, and then asked the customer to reverse the dispute. The response from the customer was: the dispute was intentional, he forgot to turn off auto-renewal, and he is upset because we didn&#39;t refund him the charge in the first place, because he is a long-time customer.

So now, fellow bootstrappers, what would *you* do in this case?

(I&#39;ll tell you what I did after I hear back from some of you).</description>

            <p>Just refund it and move on. $15 does not worth the trouble.</p>

            <p>I usually refund problem customers. They are a major PITA and I don’t want to have to deal with them unnecessarily. $15 or $30 or however much just isn’t worth the trouble.</p>
<p>If I wanted to deal with toxic people I’d get a “real job” <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>I’d recommend that in addition to keeping your fingers crossed, you upload all the relevant docs and emails to the merchant interface (e.g. refunds policy, auto-renewal warning, the conversation where they recognised this was an intentional way to bypass the policy, etc.). The clock is ticking and there is a time period for both parties to try to solve this before the bank makes a call. I’d say this person is probably going to ignore your request, and that most likely the bank will rule against you, but if you have all the docs and compelling evidence they were just trying to game the system, you may get lucky when the clock stops and they need to make a decision.</p>

<p>In this particular case, ask the customer to stop the dispute and just issue a refund.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Here’s something you may not know: if someone opens a dispute you cannot refund them unless they first close the dispute with their bank. The money (along with the dispute fee) has already been pulled back out of your card processing account. So I can’t issue the refund unless he agrees to reverse the dispute - which is what I’m hoping will happen.</p>
<p>So where are we now? So far the person has not answered. I’ll let you know how it turns out.</p>

            <p>The dispute process is weighted heavily in the consumer’s favor, and these things can often take months to get resolved.  The financial hit is unfair, but it’s better than having an open loop on the case for several months and ending up with the same result.</p>

            <p>Another agreement with the general consensus. In this particular case, ask the customer to stop the dispute and just issue a refund. Cost of doing business. Remember, Refund is always better than Chargeback. The odds of winning such chargebacks are very low in your favor anyway (been there, trust me).</p>

            <p>It’s been a long day, but I wanted to bring up a situation which arose today and see where you all stand on it. Maybe  it’ll make me feel better to get it off my chest, so here goes:</p>
<p>Today I received a payment dispute for a domain that was auto-renewed. The dispute, if it succeeds, means my company is out the cost of the domain (it’s a .io domain, so the wholesale price is $39.50 and we charge $40, basically no margin) plus the chargeback fee ($15). The customer in question filed the dispute as “Unrecognized charge”. I emailed the customer and said that I assumed it was a mistake, explained what the charge was for, and then asked the customer to reverse the dispute. The response from the customer was: the dispute was intentional, he forgot to turn off auto-renewal, and he is upset because we didn’t refund him the charge in the first place, because he is a long-time customer.</p>
<p>So now, fellow bootstrappers, what would <em>you</em> do in this case?</p>
<p>(I’ll tell you what I did after I hear back from some of you).</p>
