    <title>Help with support and development</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/help-with-support-and-development/3898</link>
    <description>Heyo....so I&#39;m kicking around the idea of hiring some help with support and some other things and wanted to see if anyone here might be interested.

I wrote a post a little while back on looking for an [apprentice bootstrapper](http://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/apprentice-bootstrapper/3059/10) - this is different from that but kind of related.

I was primarily looking for ways to mentor other bootstrappers there - whereas I&#39;m primarily looking to get some help with some of the work on my plate at this point.  But I think it&#39;s inevitable that some apprenticeship would take place in the context of this as well.

One of the challenges I faced with hiring customer support was that I still ended up having to handle probably 80% of the tickets myself b/c they were a little more technical in nature.

So what I&#39;m thinking might be a better fit is finding someone that is a developer but can also help with support.

The benefits to you, as a bootstrapper, would be that you&#39;d be able to work with an existing bootstrapped app that&#39;s profitable, and get exposure to pretty much every aspect of the business.  Also I&#39;d be happy to also help you with your own business/product, as time allows.

And you&#39;d also get paid for your time.  I&#39;m thinking maybe $30/hour but if you have a counteroffer, feel free to make it.  I&#39;m sure that&#39;s probably on the low end of what you would be making, but maybe it&#39;s still worth your while.

Initially we would be working together on support tickets / random tasks / working through code together - kind of like pair programming but just on everything as a whole - lets call it pair business&#39;ing.

I&#39;d like to start out with 1 hour per day 5 days / week just to get started and test out the waters and we could hopefully grow from there.

Let me know how that sounds and if you have any questions!</description>
