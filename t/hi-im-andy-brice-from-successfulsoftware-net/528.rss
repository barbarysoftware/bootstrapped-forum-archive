    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Andy Brice from successfulsoftware.net</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-andy-brice-from-successfulsoftware-net/528</link>
    <description>Hi started my bootstrapping/microisv journey back in 2005 with http://www.perfecttableplan.com/. I don&#39;t have any employees and I like it that way. PerfectTablePlan is still doing great and paying the bills 8.5 years later.

Other stuff:

- I blog at www.successfulsoftware.net
- I do occasional consulting for other small software companies (mostly marketing) when time allows
- I am a moderator on the BOS forum
- I have some other side projects that might develop into new products one day (one is a game for the iPad, the other a B2B SAAS app)
- I will be speaking at MicroConf Europe in October
- I am running a weekend training course for people who want to (or are at any early stage of) bootstrapping their own software business in the UK in November

I know @ian and @andrey from when we were all on the BOS forum in 2005. It is great to see that they have created such a vibrant community here.
