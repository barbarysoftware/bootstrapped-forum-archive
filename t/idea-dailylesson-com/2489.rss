    <description>**What&#39;s the product?**

DailyLesson.com is a site that allows you to subscribe to a niche emailing list that you are interested in, where you will get sent one lesson/hint about that niche daily. It will start with just a few niches such as bootstrapping and marketing. It can expand into an infinite number if niches.

Content created for the DailyLessons will also be posted to a blog style site once the mail shot is sent. This enabled google to picks it up and us to get search traffic for that
niche.

**Who is the ideal customer?**

Any one who wants to keep learning about the thing they are interested in.

**What pain does the product solve?**

It&#39;s a vitamin.

**How will it make money?**

Advertising and affiliate revenues. Each niche channel will up sell various info products related to that niche.

**Route to market?**

Start small with just two lists.

dailylesson.com/bootstrapping
dailylesson.com/marketing

Build from there.

**Notes**

Nothing to build, small amount of daily work, just need good design, exponential number of niches to move into. Content could be semi-automated with good content writers.</description>

            <p>I like the concept and the name. Generally a fan of value delivered on a predictable calendar schedule.</p>
<p>However, the public blog / advertising / affiliate part wouldn’t be my preferred method to monetize.</p>
<p>I’d go with paid membership access to the newsletter, with a portion of the content available for free. Similar to the mixergy model.</p>

            <p>Yeah, email list as the simplest SaaS possible; we talked about this in a thread a while ago.  I’m thinking of doing a couple if I ever get out of AutoLayout/Adaptive UI hell.</p>
<p>Devils Advocate: I would worry about promising daily content; seems like the content would be trivially small or a constant grind to produce or manage production.  The smallest technical problem could break the chain of daily emails.</p>
