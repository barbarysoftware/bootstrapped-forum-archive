    <title>Quickest way to get an online store going</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/quickest-way-to-get-an-online-store-going/6026</link>
    <description>I&#39;m part of various online communities that I would estimate today at about 50k very motivated / dedicated people. These communities are very focused on specific types of activities. I believe they would represent an excellent customer base for the typical things like T-shirts, mugs, ... etc. I&#39;m looking to start an online store and print motivational stuff / gear for this community and find ways to advertise it on their website/community boards/...etc. 
I could research and do this myself, but I have too many other obligations at this current time. I really just need someone to lead me in the right direction so that I can get this off the ground and running within 10 days (at most).</description>
