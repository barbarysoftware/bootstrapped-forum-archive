    <title>Your questions for Matt Weinberg</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/your-questions-for-matt-weinberg/4194</link>
    <description>If schedules work out, we&#39;ll have [Matt Weinberg](https://twitter.com/mrw) as a guest on the show next week.

Matt is the co-founder of [Vector Media Group](https://www.vectormediagroup.com/), a web design/development agency he started when he was just a teenager (many years back), and bootstrapped to a successful company of 30+ full-time employees. Vector consistently appears on the Inc. list of fastest growing companies.

I&#39;m excited to get the chance to ask Matt some questions, particularly on the topic of growing a consultancy from a one-person freelancer shop to a larger agency.

If anyone has any questions for Matt, or would like us to explore certain topics during our conversation, please leave a comment on this thread before Tuesday, July 12th.

Thanks!</description>

            <p>Was there a tipping point moment from handling small jobs (&lt; 50k) to getting bigger jobs (100k +) or has it been a case of scaling up on handling the smaller jobs.</p>
<p>From experience my consultancy (no longer a shareholder) attracted much bigger jobs once we’d got that first 100k+ contract.</p>
<p>If there was a tipping point what was it and how didi it come about?</p>

            <p>Lead generation: - how did you generate new projects/leads while you were still a small agency ie. 1-3 people, and is the approach different now with 30+ employees?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As someone who runs a very small consultancy (myself the only developer with some sub-contracting services), I have a bunch of questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Hiring</strong> - In the early days, how much salary buffer did you aim for with your first few hires?</li>
<li>
<strong>Revenue Sources</strong> - For us a significant (but far from a majority) amount of revenue is recurring “support” revenue for custom software we built that provide ongoing value to customers and need to be supported (business critical, 24/7 operation, things like that). Is this a big source of revenue for your consultancy or is it mostly coming from consistently completing and closing out projects? Can you tell us a rough split?</li>
<li>
<strong>Utilization</strong> - What utilization do you aim for with employees? That is, what percentage of time for non-overhead positions do you aim to work on billed projects? Put it another way, are you generally billing out 2080 hours/year for every salaried non-overhead employee? How has this changed over time?</li>
<li>
<strong>Project Size</strong> - billed hour / cost wise, how large are your projects and how has that size changed over time? For example, we build a lot of 100-200 hour projects. I generally avoid anything less than 40 hours of effort, unless I see a lot of opportunity with the client down the road.</li>
<li>
<strong>Billing</strong> - Do you bill by the hour? By the week? How has this changed for you over time?</li>
<li>
<strong>Contract structure</strong> - Do you generally write large contracts representing entire projects, and bill in lump sums (milestones, goals, whatever), or do you aim to establish a more loose Time&amp;Materials type arrangement?</li>
<li>
<strong>Emotion</strong> - Was there a point where running a consultancy stopped feeling like filling up a leaky bucket? If so, when did that happen for you and what changed?</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a lot of questions, but they are all interesting to me, and many of them may be valuable to others.</p>
