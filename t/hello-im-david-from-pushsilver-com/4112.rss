    <title>Hello! I&#39;m David from PushSilver.com</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hello-im-david-from-pushsilver-com/4112</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a jack-of-all-trades designer/developer hybrid. I spent the early part of my career working in agencies and freelancing and have been spending the last few years building products.

Earlier this year, I released PushSilver(.com), a micro-invoicing SaaS. It&#39;s been a small taste of what running a product is like. I&#39;ve done very literal promotion and the homepage is a joke. :-) I&#39;m interested in potentially fleshing it out more, but the app serves my needs perfectly at the moment.

I also have a number of products either in stealth mode (on active domains but with no marketing), in various stages of development/prototype phase or sitting in permanent limbo. I&#39;m searching for my next steps in going full-time with a 1-3 man team and which product to base that on.

Glad to be here, and here&#39;s hoping I don&#39;t lurk too much as I tend to do!</description>
