    <description>Hi everyone,

Most of you here know me, but if you don&#39;t I run the Bootstrapped.fm podcast and this forum along with Andrey. I’m also the founder of Userscape, where we’ve been selling [HelpSpot customer service software](https://www.helpspot.com/customer-service-software) since 2004. 

Other bootstrappers’ expertise has been incredibly valuable to me since the beginning. I know HelpSpot’s community would benefit by learning from Bootstrappers, too. 

I’ve recently made changes to the [HelpSpot blog](https://www.helpspot.com/blog), and am now sharing articles written by guest contributors, in addition to my own. I hope you’ll consider submitting a blog post on a business or technology topic you’re passionate about. 

A couple quick notes:

* I want to feature posts on many different business and technology topics (entrepreneurship, software, business, customer service…). Tell me what interests you! 

* We already have an audience waiting for you to share your expertise. We’ll promote all blog posts to our customer base and community. 

* Our HelpSpot.com domain is well-established, providing a solid foundation for guest authors who want their content to appear in relevant search results down the road.

Think you might be interested? [Check out our contributor guidelines](https://www.helpspot.com/blog/contribute), and share your topic idea(s) with us at any time. If you have any questions, I’m happy to answer them here, or you can [email me](http://mailto:ian@userscape.com).</description>

            <p>Yep, newsletter, social, and it also appears in a notification area inside HelpSpot itself.</p>
<p>We’re reworking the newsletter, it was not regular before and didn’t really have a format so that will be all new.</p>

            <p>Sounds interesting, <a class="mention" href="/u/ian">@ian</a>.</p>
<p>How will you promote guest posts? Via email newsletter? If so, do you have a sample of a recent email newsletter?</p>
