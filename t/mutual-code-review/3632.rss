    <description>Wonder if any other solo bootstrappers out there might be interested in some code review.  I miss getting my code reviewed back when I was on a team. Also kind of miss reviewing code!</description>

            <p>Hah!  I love it!  I also love the idea of improving github code review. Last time I was on a team we used the atlassian code review tool. Things like marking a comment as read/unread and the way they handled diffs were huge for me.</p>
<p>GitHub feels like a mess to me for code review.</p>
<p>Agree that reviewing random projects wouldn’t be ideal. I was imagining a scenario where you had a long term relationship with a single other person so that over time you got familiar with their app.</p>
<p>Still perhaps less ideal than a full time team member who is deeply familiar with the app. But it could work. And I’d be willing to give it a shot to find out.</p>

            <p>I’ve been feeling the same pain, but with extra irony since I run <a href="https://reviewable.io" rel="nofollow noopener">reviewable.io</a>.  However, I don’t think that reviewing code on random other projects would be very effective, since a large part of a good code review is assessing how well the design fits the requirements (requiring a deep understanding of the domain and product) and follows past design and architectural decisions (requiring knowledge of what came before).  There actually used to be a site for asking random folks for code reviews (<a href="http://lgtm.io" rel="nofollow noopener">lgtm.io</a>) but it never got much (any?) use and seems to have gone offline in the last few months…</p>
