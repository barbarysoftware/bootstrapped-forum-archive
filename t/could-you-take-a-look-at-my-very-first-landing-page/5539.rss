    <title>Could you take a look at my very first landing page?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/could-you-take-a-look-at-my-very-first-landing-page/5539</link>
    <description>This is a pre-lunch page. Except for this, nothing has been done yet.

https://learnobit.com/

I deliberately didn&#39;t use the landing page template, because I wanted to start out on a very small scale, but those seem too pro-pretend and feel vanity. (I&#39;m also tired of the photos of people smiling at the laptop.)

I thought that it was a challenge to make the description detailed while maintaining the page very light and simple,  and I think I did it somehow.

I would appreciate any feedback you give me.</description>

            <p>First impressions - This might sound harsh, so don’t take it personally. We all have to learn from feedback.</p>
<p>I don’t know what this is. Who is it for and how does it make my life better.</p>
<p>Take this text:</p>
<h1><em>If you’re crazy about <strong>Learning</strong> , let this welcome you</em></h1>
<p>^ What does this line mean?  Remove this. It has no value.</p>
<p><em>Organize, Memorize, and Retain everything you learn</em><br>
^ This is much better.  You should make this the main head line.</p>
<p><em>It wants you to do them all – Quickly, Easily, And Efficiently</em><br>
<em>(And slightly more Painfully, but as a keen learner, that shouldn’t scare you)</em><br>
^ This is not useful at all. Not sure what your website is for yet.</p>
<p><em>(Short Answer: It’s a web app that uses algorithms for learning based on Spaced Repetition,</em><br>
<em>along with a specialized note-taking tool)</em><br>
^ Getting there. Still not sure. And why short answer?</p>
<p>By this stage, I am leaving your site.</p>
<p>Also first image is not serving any purpose.  If it’s screenshot of the app, I am not impressed.  Put a screenshot below the headline.</p>
<p>There’s good stuff on the webpage, but it’s hard to find and figure out why anyone should care.  I had to really read it and that’s because I am trying to be helpful. Most people will look, get confused and leave.</p>

            <p>As a conversion rate optimization manager who focuses on landing pages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Suggest leading with a problem based headline like: “Feel like your memory isn’t working at full capacity?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subhead:  “Learn everything easier, faster, and better.  LearnOrbit helps you organize, memorize, and retain everything you learn.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your product cannot be both easier and more painful.  They’re mutually exclusive ideas and only one of them is worth paying for.</p>

            <p>Anki is a spaced repetition flashcard program.</p>
<p>My first target users are those who are already familiar with using Anki. For now. So I omitted about that.</p>

            <p>Thank you. I’d love to have feedback on both of them, but my product is now for Anki users only, so I was just looking for feedback on the landing page.<br>
Anyway, what you pointed out was somewhat intended to make the page look as humble as possible. But if that’s what people think, I’ll think again.</p>

            <p>Are you wanting feedback on just the landing page design or the product itself?  If it’s just the landing page design, I think it looks very sterile and could use more color to it.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your feedback. If I try to make the page more structured, I think I need to revise it all over, let me think what to do.</p>
<p>It was also a good point to place content based on how important it is to users. Maybe I was somewhat vain to have a big logo on it.</p>

            <p>I did not like it.</p>
<p>The landing page does not have any structure and just seems scattered around in a random fashion. You should add some structure to it - make a menu, split content into logical sections.</p>
<p>Prioritize your content more - do a smaller logo (ask yourself, does your logo really that important and bring any message to the user?), bigger header (this brings the main message), maybe add a subheader. Now, everything is at the same scale, so when you come to your page it is hard to tell where should I look.</p>
