    <title>Content analytics software to help you optimise Content Marketing</title>

    <description>Hi Bootstrappers, 

After building something no one wants, I was determined to make sure that I verify my hypotheses before trying anything new. I talked to few content marketers to know about how they did content analytics, how they managed writers and what metrics were important for them and I was able to reach an intersect of common problems. 

I have build a simple landing page for the software I want to build - [Blipmetrics](http://blipmetrics.com) but haven&#39;t written a line of code. 

What do you guys think? Do you think it solves a pain point for content marketers?</description>

            <p>I mainly implement our marketing campaigns via ReactJS/AngularJS.<br>
We are constantly pushing out new marketing materials, blog articles, music videos, and etc. without any real gauge besides Google Analytics which doesn’t provide content engagement.</p>

            <p>This is a very intriguing concept but it’d be cool to see what a Sketch of it looks like.<br>
I’d need to see what kind of metrics your recording and showing me to truly understand this.</p>
