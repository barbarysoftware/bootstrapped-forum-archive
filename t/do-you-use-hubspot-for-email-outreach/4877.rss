    <title>Do you use Hubspot for email outreach?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/do-you-use-hubspot-for-email-outreach/4877</link>
    <description>Anybody here who uses Hubspot for cold emails/email outreaches? I just started using it yesterday and reached out to around 20 people with no response. Today tried a few again and BCC&#39;d one of my own email addresses, and noticed that the email is reaching the spam folder. 

Just wondering if I should use a CRM tool at all, given that most users have them for email outreach and so perhaps their deliverability is spotty.</description>
