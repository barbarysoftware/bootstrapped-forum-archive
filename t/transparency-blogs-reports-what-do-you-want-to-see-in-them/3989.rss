    <title>Transparency blogs / reports - What do you want to see in them?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/transparency-blogs-reports-what-do-you-want-to-see-in-them/3989</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve always enjoyed following people who &#39;open source&#39; their stats and numbers, starting with Patrick McKenzie and recently with Matt from Bugmuncher. Next week I start my new part-time job, and I&#39;ll have at least one day a week to try to jumpstart some independent, bootstrapped, businesses. The first iron in the fire is my iOS app Postcard Panda, and I&#39;ve released my numbers for March in this [blog post](http://mattsencenbaugh.com/postcard-panda-march-2016-report/). 

For people who enjoy following this type of stuff, are there other things you would like to see in posts like these? What&#39;s the most useful metric to you as a fellow bootstrapper?</description>

            <p>I think it would be cool to track the hours you work on your apps/projects, and then show your effective hourly rate (much like <a href="http://www.sideprojectprofit.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Shane Labs</a> does).</p>
<p>You’re already tracking some of the most important metrics (revenue, expenses, profit), I’m not sure if it’s possible with iOS apps, but page views/conversion rates is always good to see.</p>
