    <title>Any freelancers/consultants out there using &quot;Client Portals&quot;</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/any-freelancers-consultants-out-there-using-client-portals/2385</link>
    <description>To those of you who do consulting work or freelance to bootstrap your products:
How do you involve your clients in the development process? Back and forth through email? Some project management tool?

I ask because we&#39;ve added a feature to Notedock (one of the things I&#39;m working on), where you can easily create a sort of &quot;client portal&quot;. 
We already keep client notes, files, issues, etc. in there for each project (we also do software consulting), so we added in a way for the client to log in and see everything that pertains to them. This way they can add in their own comments, upload error screenshots and what not.


I&#39;m posing this question, not to convince you to adopt Notedock, but to get a sense of how others do things. My guess would be that most people use email since it&#39;s easiest. This certainly works for us, just wanted to get some opinions to see if this is a worthwhile feature, to well...&quot;feature&quot;.

Thanks!</description>

            <p>Thanks Corey,  exactly the reasons we use one too <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>So I think I’m gonna try “featuring” this functionality,   but be a little more passive in my marketing. Just work more on getting it in front of the right people instead of trying to convince everyone.</p>
<p>I’m finding that unless they’ve already realized the benefits themselves, it’s hard getting people to switch behaviour.  It’s much easier selling to people who’ve already “self-selected” themselves and understand how the product can help them.</p>

            <p>For archival of discussions, so you can go back and find old conversations &amp; decisions if you need them.  It also gives everyone a place to reference master/latest documentation, designs, etc.  It’s all the same reasons larger companies &amp; teams use them, I think.  It helps eliminate confusion, even for small teams &amp; projects.</p>

            <p>Thanks Corey!</p>
<p>What would you say is the reason that they have some “system” instead of just using email?<br>
I can see how/why bigger operations would have something, but for the solo guys or smaller teams, is there any advantage you think?</p>

            <p>Most of the firms I know do some version of this, either with a home-built tool of their own, or through Basecamp.  And the ones that don’t do it – still need it.</p>
