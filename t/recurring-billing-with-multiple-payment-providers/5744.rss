    <title>Recurring billing with multiple payment providers?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/recurring-billing-with-multiple-payment-providers/5744</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been running a small SaaS product for a couple of years. It&#39;s not making much, but it covers the hosting costs and service fees, and requires very little effort on my part - so I consider it as a success!

The pricing is a standard monthly fee with a four tiers. As I&#39;m based in Europe I need to take into account VAT MOSS. When I started there weren&#39;t many services that took that into account (especially as I charge the same price to all customers, and eat the VAT myself), so I used Stripe subscriptions and built my own system for calculating the VAT correctly.

I&#39;ve had a couple of customers ask if I can add PayPal as an option for billing. I&#39;ve just replied saying &#39;credit card only&#39;, but a lot of my traffic comes from Russia, India, and other countries where credit cards aren&#39;t so popular, so I&#39;m thinking it would be a good idea to add another payment option.

Yesterday I spent the afternoon looking into Chargebee, but I really don&#39;t like their checkout. Although they say that they are designed to be used for recurring payments, the wording on their checkout pages doesn&#39;t really feel right. This is the flow for subscribing to a plan with a 30 day free trial. It feels more like you are buying a product, and on the last page it suggests you will be charged now, instead of at the end of the trial:

![49|690x207](upload://xEKi4o7sLLehidaXpl2taj8QQ7p.png)

For comparison, this is what the checkout I currently have looks like:

![14|417x500](upload://jOFPQPuAdu3hqR9QdLz33FAgXr2.png)

I&#39;d really like to use an third party service to handle this, as I&#39;d like more features like dunning without having to build them myself, and I&#39;d like to focus on the product and forget about billing :D I haven&#39;t really looked at Recurley or Chargify as their monthly fees are too expensive for what I&#39;m earning (my average customer MRR is around $10, and I have under 50 paying customers).

Another option would be to leave Stripe and switch to Braintree, but I&#39;d prefer to keep my options open (I like the idea of using GoCardless to handle EU bank payments), and migrating customers would take a bit of work.

What do you guys think?</description>

            <p>They are better because their UI and integration is a lot easier and more intuitive. I also don’t like their checkout form. Moreover, they are more expensive.</p>
<p>However, Fastspring has much better support.</p>

<p>Curious, how are they better? Have you had any issues charging US credit cards via Paddle?</p>

            <p>I’m not sure why you don’t like Chargebee checkout, they are pretty solid and recently got 18 mil in funding. If it’s just a personal thing, I understand, if not you should give chargebee a try, I’m pretty impressed by the product.</p>
<p>However, as a company from EU, I’m using <a href="http://Paddle.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Paddle.com</a>. They are ok, but they lack a lot of stuff on managing subscriptions(like you can’t resume a cancelled subscription from their dashboard and a few more) and respond pretty late after they got you as customer, 3 times happened to me to not respond at all and if I insist, they say I was issue with Intercom routing(which  I don’t buy, I’m using Intercom as well).</p>
<p>Anyway, they are better overall than Fastspring. I really hope that more companies like Fastspring or Paddle emerge, their biggest selling point is the VAT handling.</p>

            <p>I was also just looking into Chargebee by chance and I’m positively surprised by their product.</p>
<p>They do let you customize the text on the buttons in your checkout:</p>

<p>FastSpring used to show prices on their “Plans” page. It was around 8% per transaction. By the way, their service and customer support is good - I strongly recommend using them.</p>

            <p>As you are in the EU, I’d suggest you look into <a href="http://paddle.com" rel="nofollow noopener">paddle.com</a> of <a href="http://fastspring.com" rel="nofollow noopener">fastspring.com</a>. They both handle EU VAT and other taxes, and at least fastspring allows for invoices and some local payment methods.<br>
I’d recommend to contact support of both with specific questions, as their websites are quite vague in terms of pricing and exact feature information.</p>

            <p>We are using Paywhril. Paid plans start from $49.99 and allow multiple payment gateways, including Paypal. They are currently running a promotion (you will need to contact a support and ask for it), which cuts processing fee in half. For example, their default fee for $49.99 plan is 2%, which would be 1% with a promotion.</p>
