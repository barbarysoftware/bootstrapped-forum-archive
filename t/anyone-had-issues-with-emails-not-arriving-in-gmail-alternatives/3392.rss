    <title>Anyone had issues with emails not arriving in Gmail? Alternatives?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/anyone-had-issues-with-emails-not-arriving-in-gmail-alternatives/3392</link>
    <description>I use a Google Apps email account for my support email. (Still on the free plan as I had my domain for quite a while.)

Today I received 2 emails from prospects saying they didn&#39;t hear back the first time they emailed me. I do not see these emails anywhere in my Gmail, not in spam/all/anything.

Did anyone else experience this issue? Any paid alternatives that have better delivery?</description>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/natural">@natural</a> - Are you using a transactional email service like sendgrid, AWS SES, mailgun, or similar? Or are you delivering your own email directly? If you’re not using them, the former can be helpful.</p>

            <p>Its possible that you’re in one of the other buckets such as promotion, social, etc.</p>
<p>Here’s a tip:  Start asking people to respond to the emails you send them.  For example, when you send your very first email to people ask them a question that will elicit a response.  This will give gmail and other email service providers the idea that you’re not a spammer and people find value in your email.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a software tool.  Ask them, “What’s the number one problem you’re hoping our tool can solve for you?”</p>
<p>This should increase deliverability as more people respond.  You don’t need everyone to respond, just a few.  Hope that helps!</p>

            <p>My app also sends a lot of transactional emails on behalf of my customers and I am more annoyed by Yahoo and AOL emails as they don’t respect reply-to headers.</p>

            <p>I realise this is the opposite direction but my app sends a lot of emails and Gmail is a pain in the ass to try and deliver email to - reverse DNS, SPF, DKIM and more all setup and working fine and still emails get bounced.</p>

            <p>Fastmail. $75 a year for a respectable amount of storage, imports all your emails from Gmail without issue, support issues answered, and no worry over what Google may decide to do next with your free email. I know Google is a huge company and all, but I find it difficult to to trust anything important to a company that doesn’t get paid to provide the service. I’ve moved a lot of small companies to Fastmail over the past few years.</p>
