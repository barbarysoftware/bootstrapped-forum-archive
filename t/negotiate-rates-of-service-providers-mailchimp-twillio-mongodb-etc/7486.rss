    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m a new member and this is my first post. 

I&#39;m the developer/founder of a tool that like many other businesses uses an array of services for email, SMS to database, and hosting.  I&#39;ve heard that those rates can be negotiated, has anyone had success negotiating their rates?  Or does anyone have someone they can recommend that will help me negotiate my rates down?</description>

            <p>I sometimes write to a company’s support email, asking something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a discount available for a small bootstrapped company that is still cash-strapped and needing to carefully watch the pennies?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’d be surprised how often this gets me a sizeable discount.</p>
