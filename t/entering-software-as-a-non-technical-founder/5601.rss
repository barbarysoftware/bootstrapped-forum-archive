    <title>Entering software as a non-technical founder</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/entering-software-as-a-non-technical-founder/5601</link>
    <description>Hi everyone!

I just wanted to make this quick introduction into the community. Kyle Brown from WPSaaS directed me here and it looks like a special place.

Do you guys have any steps or a process for getting an MVP up?

I&#39;m at a point where I&#39;m not sure what type of code to build a web application for. It&#39;s going to be a rank tracker (not a Google one) with a few other features but that&#39;s the most important part.

I don&#39;t have any software development experience, but I fall under the marketer realm. My day job consists of running a few websites as the content manager and I&#39;m around software ppl sometimes, but not often enough to know.

I&#39;d also like to open up any discussion to give back on my end. I specialize in content marketing and SEO so happy to answer any questions surrounding that too! Thanks guys!</description>

<p>Actually, I found a very useful tool just for the process of validating a MVP and I wrote it earlier this week here:<br>

<p>Building a startup means dealing with lots of data outside of your app. In this detailed review of JotForm I walk through creating an MVP test survey that can provide the best test of all - collecting actual payments.</p>

            <p>Hi, Kevin. There’s a ton to learn as a non-technical founder, but I’ve written a book (free to read on the web right now with other versions coming soon.) It’s not a short read, but it should provide you with a lot of context. While there are some technical bits, it’s intentionally written at a fairly high level so that everyone on a team can understand the bigger picture regardless of their expertise.</p>
<p><a href="https://startingandsustaining.com/book/#book-progress" rel="nofollow noopener">Starting &amp; Sustaining</a></p>
<p>It won’t help much in the “where to start coding” department, but it can provide some context that might help once you start to dig in.</p>

            <p>Thank you for that answer.</p>
<p>I’m definitely not going to be learning to code, so I’ll be hiring a developer. Not looking for investors either as the software is somewhat small and spawned from the idea as an internal tool. But of course, with a commercial aspect to it as well.</p>

            <p>This question is asked often and the realistic answer is:</p>
<p>1. You can hire someone (a contractor from upwork or a full time employee).</p>
<p>It requires money, being able to pick good people (in a world where most of them aren’t) and being able to manage other people so that they deliver.</p>
<p>2. You can learn to code.</p>
<p>It requires lots of time and effort and self-discipline, it’s unclear if everyone is capable of programming at a sufficient level. On the other hand, if <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/13-year-old-girl-coder-wows-crowd-2015-7" rel="nofollow noopener">13 year old girl</a> can do it, then maybe it’s not impossibly hard.</p>
<p>And to cover the ground, there are unrealistic expectations.</p>
<p>The most common idea non-technical people have is “I will find a developer that will work for free, and give him 10% of the business”.</p>
<p>The second most unrealistic idea is “I don’t have any money to hire developers. I’ll get investors to give me money and then hire developers”.</p>
<p>As far as first steps to MVP as non-programmer, the least you can do is to create wireframes for all of UI using e.g. <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Balsamiq</a>.</p>
<p>It’ll help clarify your own thinking, it’ll make it easier to communicate your ideas to a developer or convince potential investors that you’ve thought things trough.</p>
