    <title>Good Freemium version limitations</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/good-freemium-version-limitations/6626</link>
    <description>Dear colleagues,

Two of my competing products switched to Freemium model. I am thinking of the same. 

What great limitations in a freemium software have you seen?

What limitations in a freemium software that you used pushed/convinced you later to pay for the product? 

How long did it take?

As for me I purchased a help authoring software because of a watermark in the CHM and PDF (it took me about 6-8 months). 

And purchased a music learning app because of the popular songs that were in the paid version (it took me a week or so).</description>

            <blockquote>
<p>How hard is it for users to get value?<br>
It is not that easy to users to get value using our product. It takes some efforts. Like imagine a C++ compiler or AutoCad. It is a good thing, but you need to write code / learn how to draw drawings to get a result. But those who got the result and increased their sales with our tool seems very happy and buy upgrades regularly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Do they require a lot of support?<br>
Some of them are writing to our support engineer. Mostly paid users.  But it seems our support engineer can handle twice as much requests.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How much do users interact with other users in a way that can spread the word?<br>
Not much. Some of users who achieved good results with the software are eager to share their knowledge and mastery on some chats and internet forums.</p>

            <p>I think this is the best (and maybe only really good reason I can think of) to go freemium. It provides you with a longer timeline to nurture, gain trust of, and get to know your customer base.  We’re kind of freemium with our WordPress plugin, and it provides us with a ton of insights into what podcasters and WP users are looking for. Tough part sometimes is filtering out the noise from the true needs.</p>
<p>Smart folks that I think a lot of us respect like Hiten Shah and Patrick Campbell swear by freemium as a marketing and customer acquisition channel. And I’d agree. If you have a model where it makes sense I’d absolutely try it.</p>

            <p>My example is WindowsCommander, now called TotalCommander. It has just one skippable nag dialog at the start and that’s it. I use it daily, since mid 90s. Since I was just a poor student in poor east European country I didn’t buy it for at least 10 years, not until I started earning decent money. Not the kind of timeline you should make plans for <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Now back to question on why you would want to go to freemium. I don’t think typical <strong>paying</strong> customer installs 2-3 competing products and compare them. Life is too short for that. I assume we’re not talking about something which costs a lot of money. If it costs reasonably for target market, it’s a matter of marketing (to get to customer first), and quality of product during trial to convince customer to purchase it. You should think from perspective of <strong>paying</strong> customers, you shouldn’t care much if other competitors have much more free users. Yes, bigger market share is a kind of marketing, but users searching for free are not very good customers in the first place.</p>
<p>But this is all theoretical. Maybe we’d have better insight if we knew actual products we’re discussing here.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Why are you thinking of switching to Freemium?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, because I don’t want to loose the market share.<br>
Imagine, my trial period ends on the user’s PC, but competitor software continues to work even in a crippled freemium mode.</p>

            <p>I don’t think I’d follow and switch to freemium straight away. I see this as an opportunity to change your website to advertise your product with phrases like <em>“There’s a reason we’re the best: because you get what you pay for!”</em> and so on. Another one: <em>“We charge a fee because you’re not our product, and we don’t want to bombard you with ads or shut down in a year.”</em> Make the customer think about what free really means.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not a direct answer to your question, but here’s a question worth asking: Why are you thinking of switching to Freemium? Just because some competitors did? Or because this is a strategy you want to try?</p>
<p>(BTW: some of my competitors offer Freemium, but I’m not tempted at all to do the same.)</p>
