    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Steve from Annotate - an app to gain client feedback on live or development sites</title>

    <description>Hi there, my name is Steve Heyes. I run a small dev agency in Birmingham, UK called Studio Bonito.

However, in my spare time I&#39;ve been working on an app called Annotate - http://www.annotateapp.com - the app is aimed at other web designer and developers who have a large amount of client work. *It enables you gain direct client feedback about your website removing any confusion or miss communication.*

I&#39;d love to know your thoughts about it, feel free to tear it down! This seems like a safe environment to say and do that! But check out the site and let me know what you think.

Annotate - http://www.annotateapp.com

Cheers,
Steve</description>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>I reckon you should remove the word “experiment” from the bottom of the page. I read the page, was attracted to the product, and then saw “This is an experiment” and then thought it might just be a test or not work or something. Basically I think it could turn people off.</p>
