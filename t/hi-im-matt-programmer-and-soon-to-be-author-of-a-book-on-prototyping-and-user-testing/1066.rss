    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;m a programmer by trade who is very interested in fine tuning products before they are built. My background is in human computer interaction and I stumbled upon this fantastic forum through friendly word of mouth.

Here&#39;s a post I think you might find useful if you are doing user testing right now: [One Question to Rule Them All - Getting Honest User Feedback][1]

In addition, I&#39;m hoping to interview a few bootstrappers / entrepreneur hopefuls to help nail down my book&#39;s landing page. If you are interested I would be eternally grateful and can offer you a $10 amazon egift card. 

Best of luck!
