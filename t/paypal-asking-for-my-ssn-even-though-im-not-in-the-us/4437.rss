    <title>PayPal asking for my SSN even though I&#39;m not in the US?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/paypal-asking-for-my-ssn-even-though-im-not-in-the-us/4437</link>
    <description>Seemingly because I crossed a threshold in sales quantity and revenue, I got an email from PayPal asking for one of these:

- Your Social Security number
- Your Individual Tax Identification Number
- Your Employer Identification Number

I&#39;m not from the US. I don&#39;t live in the US. I don&#39;t run my business in the US (although I have some sales to the US).

I logged into PayPal, and receive another request to do this. There&#39;s a link with more info, but the link is broken...

I searched the web for more info, and could only find poisonous discussions on poisonous forums.

Has anyone here who runs a non-US company and uses PayPal as a payment alternative faced this? If so, was it safe to ignore this strange request?</description>

            <p>Yea, that happens and - it sucks.</p>
<p>It is really anoying but they are strict for US, europe, well not that much.</p>
<p>I have also noticed that same is for Braintree, many many restrictions on how we can impplement or have an account with them.</p>
<p>I now also check 2checkout, who do seem to be resonable.</p>

            <p>And to answer my own query…</p>
<p>When I accepted PayPal’s request to “Submit” this information, I was given a choice: “I’m not in the US, not a US citizen, not required to declare taxes to the IRS”. After accepting a stern warning against fraud, PayPal accepts this choice.</p>
