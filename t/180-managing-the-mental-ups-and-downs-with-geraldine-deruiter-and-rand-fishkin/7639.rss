    <description>@peldi continues this mini-season as he chats with married couple Geraldine DeRuiter (author) and Rand Fishkin (software founder) on how their fields differ - and how they are more similar than you&#39;d think.

&lt;iframe height=&quot;200px&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; seamless src=&quot;https://player.simplecast.com/6aae9796-6d24-48e4-8d0f-7211515163ab?dark=false&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Peldi, Geraldine, and Rand discuss:

* How the software industry is less special that we think
* Dealing with the loneliness and isolation of being a founder or author
* Managing your own psychology
* How a supportive partner shares your mental ups and downs
* The value of having a peer group (aka friends) for mutual support
* The challenge to ignore the VC hype machine
