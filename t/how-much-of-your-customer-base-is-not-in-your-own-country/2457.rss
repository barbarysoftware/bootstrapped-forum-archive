    <title>How much of your customer base is not in your own country?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-much-of-your-customer-base-is-not-in-your-own-country/2457</link>
    <description>I&#39;m writing an article about the challenges we face being a tiny global business. At Perch our stats are currently around:

50% UK
20% EU not UK
30% Rest of world

I wondered if that was similar for other people? If anyone has any thoughts on what they find difficult with regards to export, selling and supporting people in other countries that would be interesting.</description>

            <p>Very roughly:</p>
<p>About 70% in America.</p>
<p>Rest mostly in Europe (including UK, where I’m based), and a handful from Asia, mainly east Asia, like Singapore etc.</p>
<p>In my not so enlightened opinion, the majority of internet users (and specifically users who pay for stuff) are in America, so unless you are American, most of your customers will be outside your country. Which is why most businesses price their products in dollars, even if they are based elsewhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/itFzSaO" rel="nofollow noopener">http://imgur.com/itFzSaO</a> (I wanted to upload the screenshot direct but not allowed).</p>
<p>Bottom line is 60/40 split UK/Rest of the world. With the US being the highest number of customers outside of UK.</p>

            <p>I’m hungarian. I sold my niche Windows utility to 50 countries so far, including exotic targets like Iraq, China, Egypt, Philippines and Japan. Japan indeed is a hard nut to crack. About 99.6% of my customers are from foreign countries.<br>
61% US<br>
8% UK<br>
6% Canada<br>
5% Australia<br>
2% Israel<br>
2% Denmark<br>
2% Germany<br>
14% other.<br>
Denmark is probably overrepresented. Something happened there last fall and I attracted tons of customers, quickly raising my danish customer count by about 600%.</p>
<p>Due to stupid EU VAT changes in effect since yesterday I switched from PayPal to FastSpring. All the tax laws are handled by them. So my biggest challenge regarding internationality is not sounding foreign to my prospects. That would cost me money.</p>

<p>Our own country (Spain) sales are about 2% of the total, I suppose because our site is only in English.</p>

            <p>Pretty much all of it. Every time we land an Irish sale it’s a WTF moment. An Irish person? Buying software online?</p>
<p>Our figures run to:</p>
<p>67% US<br>
12% UK<br>
6% Canada<br>
5% OZ</p>
<p>And the rest comes from everywhere else, with a few spikes from smaller countries such as Norway and Denmark. Non first world countries are very rare, but do happen now and then.</p>
