    <description>Hello there!

I am Zhe and I am a Chinese living in Sweden. I have always wanted to work for myself. I have tried freelancing, launch a couple of web service on the side. But nothing really takes off. Currently I am working as a developer in an online ad company and two of other projects in my spare time:

http://offerqa.com (in Chinese)
Question answer website for Chinese expats and new immigrates. I want it to be Quora for Chinese who lives abroad. Turns out it is harder to grow user base than I thought.

http://getbagsy.com
I just started this landing page two days ago and it is still working in progress. I really want to validate it before I put in more effort. (haven&#39;t showed it to anyone yet:P) Got this idea from my current employer because I heard some complaints from them. This is my first B2B SaaS project.

I am very glad to find this community and I want to learn from all of you!

Regards,
Zhe</description>

            <p>There are no easy shortcuts (that I know of). But creating good content (articles, videos, tools etc) that is interesting to your target audience, is a good start.</p>

            <p>Thanks shantung! I thought about having a trial plan for 30 days,  but then I remembered some sites like Dropbox will let you have extra features if you refer friends. Hence the salesman plan:)</p>
<p>DIBS (<a href="http://www.dibspayment.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.dibspayment.com/</a>)  is like the ancient version of strip in nordic country. Mostly used by e-commerce site.  Not sure how many SaaS companies are out there using it but the main advantage over Strip is cheap.  DIBS has a fix-rate subscription while Strip is transaction-based. So if you have over 2000 customers DIBS will be about 400 times cheaper.</p>

<p>If you are an experienced developer then creating the website/product is usually the easy bit. Getting enough people’s attention with limited money/time is the hard bit.</p>

            <p>Welcome.</p>
<p>You do say the page is in progress, but I’ll still make a few comments.</p>
<p>Obviously you need to expanding on a few sections (Manager friendly, invoice). I see a big problem in the Salesman plan- what  exactly is it doing? Who is it for? You say 2 months free, but what after that?</p>
<p>Also, what is Dibs? I’ve only heard this term in American movies, where I’m sure it doesn’t mean credit card payments <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
