&quot;Manton and Daniel continue their discussion about the challenge of succeeding in the App Stores and in general as an indie software developer.&quot; See show notes for links to articles discussed.

[Developing Perspective #192: Nobility of Effort.][2]
&quot;This past week has seen an explosion of writing and discussion about the business of making software for sale on the iOS App Store. Personally I love it when these little bubbles of discussion appear.

These discussions provide the opportunity and motivation for all sorts of anecdotes which help expand my view on where things stand.&quot;  See show notes for links to articles discussed.
