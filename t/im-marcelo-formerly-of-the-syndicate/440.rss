    <description>Hey everyone,
I discovered these forums through the Bootstrapped podcast. A few years back I bootstrapped a blog sponsorship network called The Syndicate, but have since sold it and moved on due to having my first child and not having the time to keep up with what essentially became a sales job.

I&#39;m fascinated by how businesses work, especially bootstrapped ones. I&#39;m currently sprucing my development skills by hacking on a few side projects, but eventually hope to ship a real SaaS app.

Looking forward to learning from all of you!</description>
