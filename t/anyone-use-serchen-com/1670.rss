            <p>Same here, Serchen are a nuisance. Despite previous requests for them to stop emailing me they still persist. I just flag all their post as spam now.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your replys and experiences everyone! I wasn’t thinking too highly of them, but figured I’d ask.</p>
<p>I’m definitely passing.</p>
<p>Are there any out there that have been successful for people? I’m thinking of <a href="http://getapp.com" rel="nofollow noopener">getapp.com</a> and <a href="http://capterra.com" rel="nofollow noopener">capterra.com</a> as others who have contacted me. I’ve always been pretty skeptical of these types of businesses, but maybe it works for a specific type of business/instance?</p>

            <p>Do not use Serchen!! Stay away from them!</p>
<p>After much pestering I thought I would give them a try and spent $900 on a basic listing back in January. The campaign was a disaster and last month I requested a refund. They would not give me one. To show you the difference between what I was promised and what I got, here’s what I said in my refund request email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(<em>When negotiating the sale Serchen’s sales rep said…</em>) Visitors for Idea Management are 80,000 visitors per quarter with a 3.5% CTR". I specifically asked about this as it all seemed too good to be true. This implies 2800 clicks per quarter. I was the only paid advertiser on the Idea Management page and had a nice steady stream of reviews so you’d expect i’d get a 2-3.5% CTR. I did not. I got 145 visitors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What’s more they could never produced any evidence that they get the visitor volume that they said they do.</p>
<p>Anyone can PM me if they want to find out more.</p>

            <p>They constantly email me to try to sell me their service, even though I’ve told them I’m not interested. It’s quite annoying and I should probably just mark them as spam.</p>

            <p>Hey Scott,</p>
<p>I have not heard of this site before, but if it’s anything like the others of this nature that I’ve come across it’s probably not worth it.</p>
<p>I think there is merit in paying to get listed in some places, but those places should cater specifically and uniquely to your audience. That site is clearly totally generic and I have to wonder how many of your potential customers are roaming through there.</p>
<p>I am listed on one such enterprisey site and I get nothing from there. Oh, except regular emails to ask me to pay them to move to their s\Super Gold program or whatever. No thanks.</p>
<p>Cheers man. Hope you’ve been well since Microconf.</p>
<p>Oliver</p>
