    <description>Hi,

Some of you already know me  (MrAnalogy from the Business of Software board, which is now circling the drain) but I&#39;ll introduce myself to the rest.


**My wife made me do it.**
My BS is in Electrical Engineering with a Telecom emphasis. I worked as a Telecom engineering consultant for my first few years out of school. Then went back to my first love, software development, for my next job working for a startup making Video Kiosks.

During all of that I was writing speech therapy software for my (now) wife to use with her patients. I just saw a need and needed a project to work on. Amazingly, we still sell the first program I ever wrote after college. It&#39;s one of our worst sellers. But that&#39;s a marketing problem :smile:

The software turned into a product which turned into many products which turned into a company. I didn&#39;t have any grand plans  for starting a company (didn&#39;t have the confidence to think I could do that). One thing just lead to another and viola, we&#39;ve been in business for about 19 years now.

**Current Plans**

We are about to launch a web app (mostly to address iPad and non-windows users, but also to provide a lower cost subscription pricing model).


**My interests**

1. Growing and helping other people grow
2. Marketing and sales.  Right now I&#39;m especially interested in Landing Page Optimization (or &quot;Conversion Optimization&quot;). Having lots of fun with Google Experiments right now.
3. Finding and managing freelancers (wihich  is related to #1)

            <p>I primarily meant (1 related to 3) : <span class="hashtag">#3</span> (finding/managing freelancers) is a skill that I have developed and one I’m happy to share my experience with.  I’ve naturally got lots of experience in all areas, but the Freelancer stuff is fairly recent (last 3 years or so ) so it’s the most novel to me, so it was on my mind when I posted.).</p>
<p>But you raise a good point: Working as a freelancer with an existing established company that’s willing to not only pay you but give you some mentoring sounds like a good idea.</p>
<p>I have really enjoyed this wild ride (building a company and running it for 19 years) and I’m happy to share my knowledge.<br>
Actually I’m working some a top secret project to share more of that knowledge. (That actually came up after I originally made my intro post). You can ping me for more info or wait for an official announcement in the near future.</p>

            <p>Great to have you here Clay!!! It’s been a long time, I love it when BOS members come on board. Also, I suspect you’re the longest lived company on here so really looking forward to all you can contribute.</p>

            <p>Hi Clay!  Wow it’s awesome to have someone who’s really been around the block <em>and</em> is looking to help others. What did you mean by 3 overlapping with 1?</p>
<p>Did you mean like hiring freelancers to build software and at the same time kind of mentoring them about entrepreneurship?</p>

<p>Not necessary foreign. My son at his grade 1 would have benefited from the vocabulary development applications. In some sense, it is a therapy, too. The speech therapist instead was dealing with printouts.</p>
<p>The argument about prices is valid though… people who need to recover are ready to pay for that recovery a premium.</p>

            <p>It’s actually fairly different from language learning software. Reteaching someone to speak, read or write is very different. It’s also a niche so we can charge a bit more.  If we went after a bigger market our costs wouldn’t change but we’d have to charge less to compete with very established folks like Rosetta Stone.</p>
<p>We are well established in a niche that takes years to get established in (Speech therapy) and have no marketing presence in a much broader market (language learning) that has heavy hitters with lots of marketing $$ (Rosetta Stone)</p>
<p>We’ve considered it and do distribute in the UK and Australia. It’s not very profitable b/c we don’t know enough about the local marketing and have to market through local distributors who take % cut. (If we hired someone they’d take a similar cut).<br>
It’s really not worth the effort.</p>
<p>Also, that would require:</p>
<ol>
<li>marketing expertise in that language</li>
<li>speech therapist (or  someone with a lot of language skill) to translate all the content.<br>
You can’t just do a straight translation. You’d have to look at the<br>
goal  of each exercise.</li>
<li>A market of a single language (not dialects like Mexican and Spain spanish) where folks have enough income to afford it.</li>
</ol>

            <p>Very interesting; looking at your product line I see a lot of similarity to foreign language learning software.  Have you looked into making a version of some of your products for that market?  Do you sell localized versions of your therapy software in foreign markets?</p>
