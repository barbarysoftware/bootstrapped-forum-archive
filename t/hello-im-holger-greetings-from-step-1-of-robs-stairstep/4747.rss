    <title>Hello, I&#39;m Holger, greetings from Step #1 of Rob&#39;s Stairstep</title>

    <description>Hello Bootstrappers!

I have been following the discussions and the podcast for quite some time and thought I&#39;d make it official.

My background: I live in Germany, and started my career working some years for a large enterprise.
As the corporate-reality sucked the life out of me I decided to quit. Since two years I am working as a freelancer doing development in various niches.

And of course I am working on some side projects, mainly plugins for WordPress and Joomla.

At this in point in time I don&#39;t want to reveal my products as I might have some trouble coming up in regards to the brand names. More on that in a separate thread which I will post later. *Cliffhanger alarm...*

Like many of the forum members I would not mind to have the side projects become my main gig eventually.
However revenue is just not there, yet.

Thus for now I greet you from [step #1 of Rob&#39;s stairstep approach](http://www.softwarebyrob.com/2015/03/26/the-stairstep-approach-to-bootstrapping/).

Thanks!</description>
