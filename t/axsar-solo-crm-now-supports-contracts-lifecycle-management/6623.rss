    <title>AXSAR Solo CRM now supports Contracts Lifecycle Management</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/axsar-solo-crm-now-supports-contracts-lifecycle-management/6623</link>
    <description>I was recently approached by an existing customer who asked whether AXSAR Solo CRM could be used for managing Contracts Lifecycle. Customer mentioned that one of his clients asked Salesforce for Contracts management feature, and they quoted $1m/year for the added feature which is obviously way expensive. So, they were looking for something like Salesforce but simple and cheaper solution for managing Contracts.

So I added the simple Contracts Lifecycle Management feature, and happy to announce that AXSAR Solo now supports Contract Lifecycle Management, and the feature is now live.

* Create / update contracts (Lease, Maintenance, Software Licenses)
* Search contracts &amp; filter them by contract type or status.
* Attach file to a contract
* Add comments
* Forward any contract related emails to a contract specific email inbox. Email contents will be attached to the Contract, so that one had full traceability regarding contract related email exchanges with different suppliers.

Give it a try, and please let us know your feedback - [https://solo.axsar.com/contracts](https://solo.axsar.com/contracts)

In the future, we will also add email notification capability for expiring contracts, so that one can take action before a contract expires.
