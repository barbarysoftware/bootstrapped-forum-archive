    <title>Taken advice and built a pre-launch landing page. Feedback?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/taken-advice-and-built-a-pre-launch-landing-page-feedback/3829</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve taken some advice from other people here (great stuff) and done what should have been done a while ago…built a landing page: [http://bit.ly/ABMcreate](http://bit.ly/ABMcreate) 

Any feedback you&#39;ve got for me would be amazing and I&#39;d be more than happy to return the favor with a different perspective on your work.</description>

            <p>Nice site, you get to the point and I understand what you’re doing.</p>
<p>I hate the scroll modifier.</p>

            <p>Thank you! All of this is great feedback and all makes sense to me. Appreciate you taking the time to look at this closely.</p>
<p>Glad you pointed out the name bit. It’s just “Create” - nice to know that’s not clear.</p>

            <p>Hey congrats on getting this up!</p>
<p>I like the emphasis you have on speaking to the needs of the small business owner.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how to pronounce the create/* thing. Might help to flesh that out.</p>
<p>The blue on gray background feels a bit too strong.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I’m clear on how it is that you’re changing the way web work gets done. Maybe you could flesh out the value prop / differentiation.</p>
