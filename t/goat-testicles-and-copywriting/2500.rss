Hooked On You: The Genius Way to Make Anybody Read Anything, by Ian Harris
http://www.amazon.com/Hooked-You-Genius-Anybody-Anything-ebook/dp/B00PWE8IXA/

(Not affiliate-linked)

I&#39;ve only parsed this book so far, but it seems pretty solid, as are its reviews.

One caveat is I thought I was sharing a free download with you guys and it&#39;s $2.99 now, so if you buy it and hate it please don&#39;t tell me, because I&#39;ll feel bad.

(It does appear to be free for kindleunlimited users and borrowable for Prime users, though I&#39;m not either of those.)</description>

            <p>Nice little guide. Cannot call it a full-sized book, but it worth to read, especially for novice copyrighters.</p>
<p>Here’s my notes from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Start everything with a story.</li>
<li>Right after story a short-short bridge.</li>
<li>Story is short, may be 100 words.</li>
<li>Keep things readable. There is an index that says how readable is a text. 30 - bad, 70 - good, 90 - perfect. Flesch Reading Ease test.</li>
<li>Use Reddit and other sites to collect stories.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Readability tips</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Put first sentence on 1 line.</li>
<li>Use narrower columns.</li>
<li>Keep your sentences short.</li>
<li>Put a line break after every idea.</li>
<li>Use bullets.</li>
<li>Open with a quote.</li>
<li>Include a picture of a person looking at the reader.</li>
<li>Caption every picture.</li>
<li>Sign your work.</li>
<li>Use P.S. which summarizes the idea.</li>
</ol>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion, it looks great, just borrowed it on my Kindle.</p>
<p>For those that don’t want to use Amazon, or prefer a “pay what you think it’s worth” model, it’s also available at LeanPub with a minimum price of free.</p>
