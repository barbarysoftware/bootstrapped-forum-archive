    <title>FQDN vs. Subdomain vs. Subdirectory for housing projects?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/fqdn-vs-subdomain-vs-subdirectory-for-housing-projects/2221</link>
    <description>Hi,

How do you demarcate your various projects online? Do you use a separate domain, subdomains or sub directories? e.g.

 1. AwesomeProject.com
 2. AwesomeProject.MyNameOrBusiness.com
 3. MyNameOrBusiness.com/AwesomeProject

Do you have opinions or even better quantitative proof that one approach is better than another?

According to [this thread][1] there might be some marginal benefit to separate or a subdomain.

I&#39;m torn between 1 &amp; 3. 1 feels like it might be neater, keeping things separate but 3 feels a lot more maintainable. SEO is obviously a large factor but if there&#39;s not much in it then storing everything in one place will be a lot easier.

Anyone regretting having many separate ebook, webinar, blog &amp; SaaS websites? 

Thanks

            <p>I think it also depends on how closely related your products are to each other. If they’re all for the same target market, building a brand around your business name (including keeping them all on one site) could have some value for helping you cross-sell. I haven’t tried this myself, so maybe someone else who has can say whether that approach is worth it?</p>

            <p>For SEO and “it’s clearer to customers” reasons, I use <span class="hashtag">#1</span> (all products on separate domains).  What kinds of “projects” are you asking about, though?  I’d think contributed modules &amp; libraries, open source tools, and that sort of thing should be fine as subpages of your main site.  If people are spending $$ to buy something, and you’re trying to build a brand &amp; marketing copy for a product, you’ll likely find that easier if it has it’s own domain.</p>
