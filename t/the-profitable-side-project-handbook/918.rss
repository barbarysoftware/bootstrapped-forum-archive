@rachelandrew has released her Profitable Side Project Handbook. I&#39;m in it a bit and I thought she was just doing a little 30 page ebook. Instead, it&#39;s a tomb of info on pretty much every aspect of selling digital stuff. I&#39;ve read a good chunk of it already and highly recommended checking it out.</description>

            <p>Yes, I’m planning on doing some interviews for my blog also. Stop stealing my ideas! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>I was telling my wife how you did all this one handed and she said we can’t even stay caught up on our day to day work with 4 hands. Amazing.</p>

            <p>Thanks for posting this - I’ve been amazed at the response to the book - and how lovely everyone has been in helping me promote it. Once the dust (and the chaos in my inbox) settles I’ll write up some thoughts on what launching a book is like as a self-publisher as opposed to launching one through a publisher.</p>
<p>I hope it is useful to readers, I really enjoyed writing it and talking to everyone who I interviewed. I’m thinking of doing some additional interviews with people at different stages of their product business to publish on my blog - to help promote the book but also because these stories are just so interesting. So if anyone fancies answering a few questions for me, let me know!</p>
