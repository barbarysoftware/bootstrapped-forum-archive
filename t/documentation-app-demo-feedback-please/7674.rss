    <title>Documentation app demo - feedback please</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/documentation-app-demo-feedback-please/7674</link>
    <description>Hi all, some of you may remember me as the former owner of Saber Feedback. Iâ€™ve been living the 9-5 life for a couple of years now, but the old side project itch has returned ðŸ˜Š

I realise this community is not long for this world, but Iâ€™d really appreciate feedback from you all on my _very_ early stage project. (Itâ€™s just a demo video and some basic questions at the moment)

Thanks

            <p>Looks like an interesting idea. I really like how easy the screen shots/videos are. I think the biggest issue I see would be SEO benefit. The self hosting would get around that but then itâ€™s most setup and moving parts.</p>

            <p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/serge">@Serge</a>, itâ€™s awesome to get an enterprise perspective. Thatâ€™s a great point about the people writing the docs not being those creating the screenshots. Thatâ€™s exactly how it was when I worked at FreeAgent (a 250+ person company).</p>
<p>Iâ€™m primarily aiming at small/1 person web apps, simply because thatâ€™s something I know about from running Saber. I found it hard to keep on top of docs, with screenshots and videos taking a lot of time. Of course in those companies it is mostly likely the same person writing the docs and taking screenshots.</p>
<p>That said if this tool could be useful to large companies that would also be great <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>The demo Iâ€™ve built is doesnâ€™t interfere with the customer site at all, and doesnâ€™t require a browser plugin. Instead it loads the site being documented in an iframe. Of course that could be a problem depending on the customerâ€™s <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>, Iâ€™m hoping for the majority of users it will be fine as theyâ€™ll be able to run the docs app on their own subdomain. Worst case scenario theyâ€™ll have to modify their <code>frame-src</code> directive to include that domain.</p>
<p>When you say yearly licence do you mean for an entirely self-hosted on site version (ie: both the docs <em>and</em> the tool to create them are self-hosted)? As thatâ€™s a road I definitely do not want to go down. The back end service is required even if youâ€™re exporting docâ€™s HTML for self hosting, as the screenshots and videos are initially saved locally as blobs, those blobs need to be uploaded to a server for the rest of the world to see.</p>
<p>Thanks again for filling in the form, and Open Source Drums looks really cool, Iâ€™ll definitely be following that <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blush.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>

            <p>Interesting idea. I gave you some feedback from my Enterprize point of view. Might not be the target customer but the problem exists in large dev shops too. Documentation is always a poor child and the biggest hurdle is that the people writing the documentation are always asking for screen shotsâ€¦and no one in the team has time to do those screen shot for themâ€¦ and often times, they donâ€™t have full access to a customer version of the app (we do custom dev tooâ€¦large enterprisesâ€¦) Nice also that you can get a movie out of it simplyâ€¦ That is way coolâ€¦ It should not interfere with our app though, so it is a browser extension? That would be the bestâ€¦</p>
<p>I sure would have our doc team look at it. Not sure about the monthly model though. Much easier to get a licence price for itâ€¦ even if it is for one year maintenanceâ€¦ 300$ per seat is a no brainerâ€¦ even more is possible I think â€¦ I would actually try it at 799$ a seat with enterprise and see what you getâ€¦</p>
<p>Naturally, self hosting is a must for usecases like the one I am talking about. Even if I was documenting one of my own apps, I would want to self hostâ€¦ Splits my brain to have my doc hosted on another hostâ€¦</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
