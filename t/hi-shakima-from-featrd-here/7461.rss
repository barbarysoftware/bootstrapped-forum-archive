    <title>Hi, Shakima from Featrd here!</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-shakima-from-featrd-here/7461</link>
    <description>Hi everyone!

Excited to join the community. Here&#39;s a brief introduction about me in bullet points for readability:

* I live in NJ and have two cats named Pebbles and Panda
* I am a self-taught developer building Featrd - a platform for businesses to better manage feature requests from their customers.
* I love anything creative such as drawing, knitting, crocheting, making leather wallets
* I&#39;m only an introvert when topics get nerdy enough :stuck_out_tongue: 
* Speaking of, I LOVE video games as well.

Well there&#39;s my hodge-podge of rando introductory things, look forward to meeting people and connecting!

Warm regards,
Shakima</description>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the welcome and for hosting this forum <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=9" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:">.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, when I first started building Featrd, it was purely a passion project aimed at solving a super frustrating problem at my current job. Since I’m just getting started and your company is a veteran in the space, I’ll probably be a goldfish in the sea of whales that swim in the feedback-related ocean.</p>
<p>I am definitely going more niche for sure. I know there are other companies that aim to be the all-in-one solution for everyone and replace some of the tools in their tech stack. I am looking to solve just one problem for now.</p>

            <p>Welcome from a competitor! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>It’s certainly a crowded space but with dedication and consistent marketing I think it is possible to carve out a niche.</p>
