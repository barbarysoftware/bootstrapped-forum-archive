    <title>Why is my SaaS not converting?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/why-is-my-saas-not-converting/4821</link>
    <description>The site in question: https://www.linguaquote.com - a sort of high-end, curated translation marketplace.

Been building this out as a side-project for a number of years now. The product is 90% ready (always something to improve...) and functional, have been using it myself, but of the 3000 &#39;regular&#39; visitors since my last 5-10k+ traffic spikes from decent content, only 200 have visited the registration page, **none of whom have signed up.** :anguished:

So before I go ahead and try to drive masses more traffic to the site by content writing and adwords etc., what else can I improve?

###Things I&#39;ve done to some extent:
- Reworked the site copy from boring marketing-speak blurb to something with a bit more character and addressing client concerns.
- Worked (for way too long) on page load time optimisation, ridding third party script loading, caching etc.
- Gone from fixed subscription (with free 30 day trial, requiring CC to weedle out the tyre-kickers) to pay-to-post, with a later subscription option (upsell) if they find it useful. That&#39;s a much more recent change, yet to see any impact though.

###Things I want to do
- Add a video or animated gif of some kind as an intro, with a personable feel
- Add testimonials (have none from clients directly yet, but could ask the translators who have signed up to provide a few?) and perhaps even logos of companies the suppliers have worked with? Or is that too much of a stretch?
- Remove the need to register first, but can&#39;t find a &#39;nice&#39; Drupal way to do that yet.

I think I&#39;m better positioned than I was a year ago, knowing better who I&#39;m targeting, but it&#39;s still obviously not hitting the mark.

Thanks for looking :green_heart:</description>

            <p>Thanks for the tip off - yeah, had unfortunately noticed. I think I set one too many heights in the CSS, among a few other gaffes. Will endeavour to keep sorting once I crack the content/conversion thing a little more.</p>

            <p>Hey <a class="mention" href="/u/luxpir">@luxpir</a>,<br>
Just my 2 cents here, the new home page has quite a few glitches when viewed on mobile (I’m on an iPhone 6). Sorry, I tried posting screenshots here but I’m too much of a new user be able to upload images on bootstrapped it seems <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
You may want to have a look into it once you settle with the new content.</p>

            <p>Cheers, <a class="mention" href="/u/stevemcleod">@SteveMcLeod</a></p>
<p>New page is up now. Still far from optimal, need to tweak copy quite a lot and add that screencast, but overall I’m hoping it’s more appealing at this point to prospects. I <em>think</em> the content marketing onslaught may now begin.</p>
<p>Thanks again all for your input. I think I find it hard to see my own projects as objectively as I do others’.</p>
<p>Will report back with any further success or pre-success events. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blue_heart.png?v=5" title=":blue_heart:" class="emoji" alt=":blue_heart:"></p>
<p>PS - the old front page can still be seen at <a href="https://www.linguaquote.com/welcome" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.linguaquote.com/welcome</a>, for posterity’s sake.</p>

            <p>Good stuff. Let us know if you start getting some sign ups.</p>
<p>A really good thing about a very simple step 1 of the sign up process is you’ll start getting some email addresses from people who are clearly interested in your service but abandoned the next step of the sign up process.</p>

            <p>Quick update: <a href="https://www.linguaquote.com/home" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.linguaquote.com/home</a> is still a WIP but if you want to check out the direction, feel free to have a look.</p>
<p>Still need to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video (settled on a screencast for now - but not convinced it’ll boost conversions after reading around - for a service marketplace, that is)</li>
<li>Logos of companies the translators have worked with</li>
<li>A carousel of profile text with logos</li>
<li>Perhaps an example of what people can expect to pay (the translators) such as a max-min per-word range for the site</li>
<li>Make features/benefits and use-cases clearer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that pricing is currently set to <em>free</em> because I need to get feedback still and I was perhaps jumping the gun charging, plus I could even be happy with a sponsorship model if things pick up.</p>
<p>Note also that registration requires just an email address now. I toyed with building the reg form into the create project form, but there were complications in how the backend is set up, permissions and various bits of logic.</p>
<p>Am also testing adding the single email box reg form to the front page labelled “Step 1” with a button labelled “Step 2: Create project” to reduce friction by one click.</p>
<p>Fill your boots.</p>

            <p>The lowest hanging fruit is your sign up page. It should have 2 fields only: email and password. If you absolutely need more information, ask for it later. Why do I need to upload a logo or tell you where I live if I just want to get something translated? You are not making it easy for people to give you their money.</p>
<p>The other option is to take advantage of their sense of immediacy and not even ask for email and password at first. Just let them upload a document and post the job. Then ask for email and CC info at the last step, once they have already invested some effort into it.</p>

            <p>Cheers - have messaged you, Kevin.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/clay_nichols">@Clay_Nichols</a> - Completely reasonable. Let me get the base offer and pricing down and then I think I’ll work on the fine-tuning via chat etc. - Had Zopim on a business site once and it was simple to use with a Google Talk/Hangouts account. Then tried a Drupal-specific chat more recently. It worked, but as I say, was quite resource and time-hungry. Not averse to it, just need to probably present the offer better first.</p>

<p>As for chat, I’ve had a chat feature on-site before, and found it excellent. I like them myself on other sites. But it’s a timesink and resource-hog so it got shelved.</p>

<p>Chat can be distracting.<br>
You could “staff it” only for a few hours a day while doing non intensive stuff.</p>
<p>I can think of no better use of your time than confirming the customer’s needs and impression of your site.</p>

            <p>My initial impressions…</p>
<p>As someone else mentioned, it is a little text-heavy. All different coloured underlines that slashed across the page make it difficult to focus. I’m sure you have plenty of other feedback above for the homepage so I’ll leave it there.</p>
<p>The registration page is another important part in that you didn’t receive a single sign up from 200 users who clicked to sign up for 7.99. The number one reason I would not sign up after hitting that link is because the form doesn’t look professional. There are a couple of layout issues in Chrome (upload button really close to “choose file” in the logo section).</p>
<p>This is exacerbated by the fact that the form is asking for way too much investment. I haven’t even paid yet. It’s far too easy for me to disappear and go find something else. My suggestion would be to create a registration process that is as simple as possible. Remove company profile and contact info. Ask for simple details. If you require further information, allow them to sign up first before prompting for a complete profile or specification of their requirements. It requires much less investment from the visitor and will give you at least some contact info you can potentially use to follow up with later.</p>
<p>Edit: seems like all of that’s been covered! Kudos to this forum. Some very good suggestions above.</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing to disrupt the buyer’s mental model</p>

</aside>
<p>Not a bad thing, but an awfully hard one.</p>
<p>You’d need to hold the visitor attention while all they want to do is leave. And not just attention, but a comprehension - they should realize their current model has deficiencies and even pains and there is a better way.</p>
<p>I doubt it is even possible for visitors from Google - they click Back too fast.</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing to disrupt the buyer’s mental model - BUT: you must communicate clearly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s so obvious, but I get wrapped up in some train of thought that’s totally disconnected from reality sometimes. Thank you for pointing that out. At the same time I don’t want them to have to read a how-to, but if they can grok it in a few seconds I’ll be happy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I know in my case, as a buyer, I get excited about products that have different models and incentives</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good to know - I think I do too. Models like Leanpub or <a href="http://Pronoun.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Pronoun.com</a> have captured my interest for long stretches of time in the past.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From this discussion, it sounds like an easy first step is to do some A/B testing with his site copy and possibly the registration flow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I’m going to go straight for the overhaul, as ‘A’ has been running for months and not getting anywhere. So Bs improvements will be marked, if they hit the right spot.</p>
<p>Here’s the plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebuild homepage in Paragraphs (see <a href="http://paragraphs.site-showcase.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">example site</a>)</li>
<li>Clarify one-liner offer above the fold</li>
<li>Clarify copy throughout, to cover the model, offer and benefits better</li>
<li>Put explainer video above the fold</li>
<li>Bring in imagery in background and in-line (bye-bye top 2% of website page load times… need to perhaps write up why page load times aren’t everything when you’re only loading confusing messaging)</li>
<li>Make registration page simpler: email/password or email only</li>
<li>Add landing pages for specific languages</li>
<li>Consider restoring the front page quote engine (I have one semi-built) that jumps to the register page</li>
<li>Decide on a pricing approach and go with it (job board and/or agencies paying subs)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last point is the toughest nut to crack. I’ll put more thought in. Comments still welcome on that front.</p>
<p>Give me a few days and I’ll get back to you with the improved pages.</p>
<p>Really appreciate everyone’s input. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/green_heart.png?v=5" title=":green_heart:" class="emoji" alt=":green_heart:"></p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p>Since Steve said that about individual landing pages I’ve been looking at top language service provider (LSP) sites and they do exactly that. I’d seen it before, but had never thought to implement it. But they’ve done it reasonably seamlessly, i.e. you only really land there from Google/DDG/Bing, then get sold to in a relevant context.</p>
<p>Thank you for the example content for the landing page. I wouldn’t have thought about all of that in a month of Sundays. I do have sample translations on my own freelance website, and I think they’re the best way forward. Guarantee is a great plan - they seemed to always work on the old long-form sales pages.</p>
<p>As for chat, I’ve had a chat feature on-site before, and found it excellent. I like them myself on other sites. But it’s a timesink and resource-hog so it got shelved. But when this page is converting and I am confident the chat will be manned, I’ll definitely go for it again. Although I’m probably missing some great feedback in the meantime…</p>
<p>The registration page, addressed elsewhere in the thread, is due for an overhaul.</p>
<p>I’ve just stumbled upon ‘Paragraphs’ for Drupal today. It looks like it can create some really dynamic pages in no time, so I’ll rebuild the main and sub landing pages in those. Probably templated for the sub pages. Feels like a bit of a breakthrough, as I was struggling to style Panels, and working within its constraints.</p>
<p>Next reply to ben.collins will set out my checklist for the new homepage…</p>

            <p>Right, fairly solid arguments, just a few points to comment on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can imagine the “uncommidified” corner can only exist in some areas, such as ads copy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few more areas than that, namely the technical, financial and legal. Translation as an industry is still growing with global trade, so some addressable demand for non-commodity translation should be around for at least the foreseeable future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Buyers come to the site with a mental model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I can communicate to them that (a) You only pay the translator directly or (b) you pay a posting fee and the translator directly (as per a job board) then I’d probably be able to clear up the confusion a bit.</p>
<p>I’m just in two minds now over the model.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To fill up the marketplace? It will attract the crappies, cheapest, most unreliable types.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this model, where agencies pay but freelancers/buyers don’t, there is a conflict of interest if the agencies work with crappy translators. Which many do, after presenting top translators’ CVs and qualifications. Remember though that I’m only approving accounts for verifiably experienced translators. So the crappies don’t get through. It’s not a problem to fill the supply side. For agencies to be high quality I’d need to see ISO certification (I know, I know, but it’s a start) and check their reputation from various sources. There are also national/international translation agency associations with codes of conduct. That kind of thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Agencies are expected to support their own competition in the race to the bottom? o_O</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fun point, but I don’t see it playing out like that, given the above. If they want another source of leads and some simple placement tools for languages they can’t cover (at that particular moment), a cheap subscription wouldn’t be an unreasonable purchase. To my mind, at least. Presumably they’d be confident enough in their services to put their own USP forward in their proposals. They can truly take the leg-work out of a large translation project for buyers, at a cost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The issue is […] that the value is not demonstrated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yep. For sure. After a reply or two more I’ll post my checklist for the new main landing page. Perhaps see if it makes sense to you.</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing to disrupt the buyer’s mental model - BUT: you <em>must communicate clearly</em>.  Disrupting the buyer’s mental model and not communicating what you’re doing will lead to exactly the outcome you suggest: “this isn’t what I’m looking for.”  But I know in my case, as a buyer, I get excited about products that have different models and incentives because it feels like an actual alternative, instead of an also-ran.</p>
<p>From this discussion, it sounds like an easy first step is to do some A/B testing with his site copy and possibly the registration flow.  He already has traffic that should be enough to get a few conversions, so funnel a 20-30% of them into a version of the site with some improvements and see what happens.</p>

            <p>Great advice.<br>
++1  for “individual landing pages” for each use (and I’d argue for each language).</p>
<p>How about if you pick your “low hanging fruit” LANGUAGE and make a killer landing page:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simple, clear benefit</li>
<li>Sample of one of your translations. (Presumably, if you are shooting for high end, your customers hopefully can spot the difference between good/bad translations. If not then you have a HUGE problem of convincing them you’re better)</li>
<li>How about a money back guarantee on a RANDOM paragraph of their document? (so your translator starts with one random paragraph and submits that to them)</li>
<li>Poor conversion from “landed on registration page &gt; registered”:  I think that’s because of the landing page.  The registration page gives me_no additional information_, only more work to do before I can proceed.</li>
<li>What is the smallest, easiest next step for the user?</li>
<li>Have you considered having a chat option?  That is the BEST way to find out what your customers want/need from the site.</li>
<li>Stress “accurate, natural translation” (somehow stress that the translation will look like a native speaker wrote it.)</li>
</ol>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <blockquote>
<p>An alternative could be to explain this as a “flat rate” thing. “The translator sets their own price; we merely take a flat fee instead of a percentage. You get the best price, they get the best wage, and we don’t get in the way.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s where I think the confusion over pricing has arisen, that we haven’t communicated what you’ve picked up on here. We’re stepping aside once we’ve paired up the working relationship. There’s simply less conflict of interest this way. We also avoid having to handle large (in theory) sums of money, when we’d only be taking a small cut, and incur all of those associated risks.</p>
<p>The original model, years ago, was to charge translation agencies a monthly subscription (£25-35) for access to the tools and curated talent pool to cover their staff shortages and keep their lead/prospect pipeline full. Freelance translators could make proposals/quotes alongside the agencies, at no cost, provided they met our criteria (association membership/degree/experience).</p>
<p>Then at some point I tried to simplify the pricing, so that buyers could pay a job-board type of flat fee to simplify their translation project workflow. I’m actually starting to think the original model was best - having the agencies with deeper pockets support free accounts for buyers and freelancers.</p>
<p>After our discussions here today, there still seems to be resistance to the idea that even if the site offered buyers value, they might still be reluctant to pay for it. Even if they were business users. Partly because of the unconventional model, partly because they expect not to pay.</p>
<p>I’m starting to think that if I can crack the pricing, it’d remove another barrier to sales. It’s just settling on a model that the mean target visitor would see as fair and normal.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I hear you, but that’s specifically the model I’m trying to avoid. I’ll reply to ben.collins now in more detail, but basically his suggestion is more in line with the strategy.</p>
<p>It’s to do with reversing the commodification of the industry, or at least preserving an uncommodified corner of it. They can meet new clients through the site, have their own relationship with them. We put them in touch, help them work, stay out of the way.</p>

            <p>Cheers, thanks for that. Two quick points before replying… 1) You’re seeing a version that’s less wordy than the initial version presented in the OP. 2) That version is now more of a WIP than the OP.</p>
<p>“Brutally honest”… well, it’s honest, but hardly brutal. You mean you didn’t sugarcoat it, of course, but I’m not 100% sure if your assumptions were all correct <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I think your overall message was that the site basically doesn’t convey what sets it apart from other translation services, agency, platform or otherwise.</p>
<p>The front page <em>used to</em> show all the translation associations we source translators from, proving that the translators have met their minimum entry requirements (so are not just any old ‘bilingual joes’) and adhere to their standards, so have accountability. It did not have examples of work done, or of the compelling translations available from these linguists.</p>
<p>The CTA being unclear we’ve covered above, and has given me pause for thought on the model. I’ll be repying to rfctr and ben.collins shortly to outline where I’m at on that front.</p>
<p>As for the copy - it being opinionated <em>is</em> sort of the idea, in that it hangs out our shingle telling folks our attitude and values, hoping to attract like-minded clients. But overly opinionated is perhaps as bad as not at all, so will keep working on that. WIP, as mentioned, so appreciate the mention about that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re offering access to translators. You’re a translation agency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So briefly back to the USP not being communicated - we’re aiming more at being a marketplace than an agency proper, so you manage your own project using our tools and our curated pool of linguists. This info is missing, definitely. It would help to differentiate the service if it was there, so cheers again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the trouble of sourcing reliable translators […] not a pain I recognize.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not convinced you are the exact target persona we’d be looking to attract, given that you’re already familiar with the industry and where and how to hire translation talent. For those who aren’t, bearing in mind it’s a growing industry, we want to give them a foolproof way to do that, without having the worry of being tricked/overcharged/mislead etc.</p>
<p>To convince <em>you</em> to use us, I’d probably try to sell you on the multi-language project management feature, should you ever come across a project in multiple language pairs (app, website, product descriptions?).</p>
<p>Being able to build your translation team in minutes and having their deliveries and discussions on a single page instead of scattered about your inbox, repeating instructions and updates to each translator etc. - it’s a clear time and stress saver. Is that worth the ticket price? Your call. I’d say it was cheap. Perhaps too cheap. But none of that is communicated clearly either, so you raise a valid point again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really don’t want another translation management tool. Or if it is one, why aren’t you positioning it as such?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a tool and talent pool combined. The tool side of the copy has been neglected since the v0.1 of the front page. I used to have a feature matrix up on a pricing page, showing the features for file encryption, group messaging, applicant management etc. but tried to simplify the copy. May have gone too far…</p>

            <p>I don’t see the issue with “there’s too many words”.</p>
<p>The amount of words really doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>What matters is the offer and the audience.</p>
<p>Here’s my <em>brutally honest</em> assessment below:</p>
<p>Perhaps I would be a good target audience for this (I hire translators on occasion and I’ve worked as one, as well).</p>
<p>This website doesn’t work for me, because it’s a translation agency website like about 1,000 other ones. There’s just no compelling reason to choose you over a more established player.</p>
<p>You’re offering access to translators. You’re a translation agency.</p>
<p>You might think you’re a sort of high-end, curated translation marketplace but I don’t see any evidence of this.</p>
<p>There’s no proof that you have “<em>Highly experienced, translation association member translators</em>” (who would claim the opposite anyway?), nor is there any proof that I’ll get “<em>Translations that engage, inform, influence and convert</em>”.</p>
<p>Secondly, because I don’t really understand the CTA - “Get Started just 7.99”. What will I be starting? And why would I pay for it? I usually think in terms of cost per words/lines/pages…</p>
<p>“<em>We live for translation and languages</em>.” -&gt; I’m reasonably sure you don’t <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> (if you offered your service for free, perhaps I’d think that could be the case…).</p>
<p><em>We save you the trouble of sourcing reliable translators and the overhead of working with an agency.</em> =&gt; that’s not a pain I recognize. After all, you’re an agency. Most of the work is working with the translator, regardless of whether I hire them directly or from an agency.</p>
<p>“<em>No more marathon email threads or time lost tracking down attachments. It’s all in one place</em>.” =&gt; I really don’t want another translation management tool. Or if it is one, why aren’t you positioning it as such?</p>

            <p>An alternative could be to explain this as a “flat rate” thing.  “The translator sets their own price; we merely take a flat fee instead of a percentage.  You get the best price, they get the best wage, and we don’t get in the way.”</p>

<p>they work directly with the freelancer, we take no commission</p>

</aside>
<p>I see now. I see it as a problem. It is just too confusing. I now have two things to pay for, one of which is clear (the work I need to be done) and the second has a questionable value for me.</p>
<p>If I were you, I’d get take your cut from the translators - after all, you’re sending work their way. Referral fee would also be larger than 8, eh?</p>

            <p>Thank you. I have seen that info several times over the years, and seem to have actively disobeyed the common convention.</p>
<p>##<span class="hashtag">#Why</span>?</p>
<p>I think because I wanted to vet all the buyers at one point, to make sure the translators and I knew who we/they were dealing with. Perhaps it was seeing the full forms required on the likes of <a href="http://designinc.com" rel="nofollow noopener">designinc.com</a> and <a href="http://gun.io" rel="nofollow noopener">gun.io</a> that made me think that this is a B2B product like theirs, promising savings in time and money, not a free mass-market todo-list app or some such (much respect to the todo list makers, I’m one too!). But I take your point that just getting name/email is enough to get the ball rolling on both sides.</p>
<p>So the importance you’re putting on this point, and the other points of friction you’ve all identified today, once rectified, should hopefully see me maybe coming back to you all with a first conversion at some point soon… he says hopefully.</p>
<p>I mean you don’t get any conversions for a while and you start to question the product and its fit in the market. And why I haven’t better validated it by now. It was just one of those projects, as a translation agency owner myself, I knew would be useful to me and hopefully 1000s more. But knowing it myself isn’t the same as facing the market in the cold light of Google…</p>
<p>EDIT: There are similar business models making money in this industry in others, so it’s relatively certain I can convert at least 1 person this year, if I sort out the offer presentation.</p>
