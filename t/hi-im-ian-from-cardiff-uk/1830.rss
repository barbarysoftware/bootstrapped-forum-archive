    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Ian from Cardiff, UK</title>

    <description>Hi everyone - I&#39;m Ian from Cardiff in the UK.

I&#39;m a freelancer at [Nifty Digits][1] who has spent the last couple of months working on a payments product called [Inlet][2]. It allows you to accept orders through paypal and stripe and provides analytics on where your income is coming from. It&#39;s getting pretty close to being ready for a select few to play with. 

I also run a couple of other sites - availability.is - A small, simple availability publisher for freelancers and fairandbare.com - an ethical tshirt shop where designs are sourced from visitors. 

Prior to freelancing I worked full time on a stop motion feature film in Bristol for Aardman. I&#39;m considering building an open source pipeline for features if I can make it work. See vimeo.com/39295205 for more on that.

Anyway, hi all - I&#39;ve been stalking the bootstrapped world for some time and it&#39;s about time I got involved. I&#39;m looking forward to learning from everyone here.
