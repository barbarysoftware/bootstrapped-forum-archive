    <title>Selling to e-commerce owners (product almost there, looking for tips)</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/selling-to-e-commerce-owners-product-almost-there-looking-for-tips/4559</link>
    <description>Dear Bootstrapers,

This is my second approach to turning a side project into a business. So far I&#39;ve fared much better than last time.

In short, I&#39;m fixing broken product pages &amp; sold out items in any e-commerce site. I learned that while e-commerce owners might not be familiar with what UX is - they are definitely aware of the issues that arise when potential customers land on expired/broken pages. This is particularly true in the fashion vertical where plenty of traffic is driven by social media and one cannot predict/control how long a link will &#39;stay fresh&#39;.

I&#39;m currently pursuing a typical sales funnel - I&#39;m using my network and cold calling web-shops to land meetings to talk about the problem and present my solution. 

As you might have guessed, trust is of paramount issue here, I&#39;m aiming for directly sparking interest of potential partners over phone or by being introduced. I have the impression that my web-presence ([Keepleads](http://keepleads.eu)) is not a problem yet, because of word-of-mouth. Hopefully by the end of the year a medium-sized shop will have tested out my solution live, so then I have hard facts (stats) and arguments (references) to land more meetings.

Was anyone in a similar situation selling to this particular audience? Any insider tips? Should I pursue social media presence on LinkedIn? Any books/courses I should read? I doubt that targeted advertising would work, but I&#39;m open to ideas.</description>

            <p>Yes. Shopify has 300K shops on its platform, 70% of those shops install at least one app. My sales have come exclusively from Shopify app store. The easy days are over (the gold rush was 2-3 years ago) but if your app can get past initial traction in the store it’s still a solid distribution channel.</p>

            <p>Thanks for answering. Are you suggesting Shopify integration as a sales channel - using their markeplace to gain visibility - or a Shopify integration for the value in it itself?</p>

            <p>Obvious next step seems to be integration with the major ecommerce platforms. Personally I 100% focus on Shopify and it’s worth it.</p>
