    <title>Hi, I&#39;m Ray from Taiwan</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/hi-im-ray-from-taiwan/1493</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,

My name is Ray and I&#39;m currently making iOS apps for a living, mostly for other people at this point. I&#39;m hoping to build up a solid consulting practice and eventually graduate on to a product-focused business. Inspired by all of you who are working at this all over the world. The hardest challenge for me is talking to people to figure out something that enough people are willing to pay for. There are times when it feels like I have no idea what people want! 

PS. This is my tie-tying app that I built to scratch an itch https://itunes.apple.com/tw/app/face-tie/id570542131 I&#39;m open to collaboration, consulting gigs or design/development skill bartering if you&#39;re in need of a good iOS dev.</description>
