    <title>Could you give me feedback on Inlet.io?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/could-you-give-me-feedback-on-inlet-io/2092</link>
    <description>Hi All,

I recently pushed out a new version of landing page for my soon-to-launch ecommerce app, [Inlet][1]. It&#39;s intended to be a simple way of selling products across multiple payment providers, with current support for stripe and paypal. Currently, there are a few screens on the landing page showing basic functionality. If anyone has got any feedback or questions I&#39;d love to hear from you.

Cheers,

Ian

            <p>Thanks everyone. I appreciate your time.</p>
<p>I guess I need to pitch it along the lines of “Give your customers a flexible checkout” or something along those lines, to make it clear why allowing stripe and paypal is a <em>good</em> thing for them.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/coreysnipes">@coreysnipes</a> is right. I once setup the payment gateway for a site I was trying to build, and it was a nightmare since it was my first “serious” website ever. I get the point, but you have to make it clear at the landing page. Maybe an example of the code? I agree that the paypal and stripe are too big.</p>
<p>Target one audience. For the less-technical, I would just say that besides setting everything up, you have two options to choose the provider: paypal and stripe.</p>

            <p>To echo <a class="mention" href="/u/coreysnipes">@coreysnipes</a>, it feels like you really need some more text on there that explains what it does in a bit more detail.</p>
<p>I get it from what you’re writing here, but there’s no indication of that on-page at the moment.</p>

            <p>Hi Corey. Thanks for checking it out and your feedback, much appreciated. At the moment, the core proposition is “setting up all that payment stuff” for less technical users.</p>
<p>I’d like to be able to offer several gateway options however so that it appeals to more technical users. Think an api for multiple gateways. The main problem I was attempting to solve originally is a way to easily integrate payment options without having to develop a full fledged commerce layer.</p>

            <p>The page has a nice design, and I think showing the checkout page and graph are a good choice.</p>
<p>The value proposition is unclear to me.  On the page, “stripe + paypal” is so prominent, that it feels like that’s the selling point.  But I don’t understand why I’d want to use both.</p>
<p>Is this for less-technical sellers who don’t want to have to understand and muck with “all that payment setup stuff”?  If so, I’d focus on the simple checkout &amp; nice reporting.  Stripe + Paypal should be mentioned much smaller &amp; lower.</p>
<p>Or is it for more technical users who know they need to use multiple payment processors?</p>
