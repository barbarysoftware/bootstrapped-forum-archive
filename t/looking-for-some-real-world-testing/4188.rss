    <title>Looking for some &quot;real world&quot; testing</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/looking-for-some-real-world-testing/4188</link>
    <description>Hello,

since some weeks I am working on my product and I am quite happy with the progress - not too much of development and focusing on copy and marketing. Well nothing is perfect but I guess thats ok.
 
Now I would like to let some beta users using the product and was wondering if some here would like to be one of them? 
Ideally you have a website running that has some kind of medium/long html form i.e. like a registration form on it.
