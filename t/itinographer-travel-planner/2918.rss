    <title>Itinographer - Travel Planner</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/itinographer-travel-planner/2918</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve recently completed a travel planning MVP called [Itinographer][1]. The idea is that you plan your trip in the desktop web app and download it to the iPhone app before you travel.

I got into smartphones and GPS in 2004 when PocketPC Phone Edition came out. Over the years I made some apps that tracked multi-day mountain treks and plotted them on Google Maps. I was going to do an iPhone version but the first iPhones didn&#39;t support background location tracking so I worked on something else. Last year I wanted to do another mobile app and so decided to go back to my interest in travel tech. 

At this stage I&#39;m looking for user validation. I&#39;m trying to get users through paid advertising, though Google pulled my ad saying my landing page violated it&#39;s policies, not sure why. I was a bit disheartened when I saw the Hacker News post saying that [travel planning software is the most common bad startup idea][2].

I would be interested in what people think of my take on this software genre, what problems you encounter when planning trips and what software you currently use.

<p>It is pointless. Why you do not do a full-stop and find a niche without big competitors and with at least some minor user loyalty?</p>

            <p>That’s really useful feedback.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, TripIt’s auto-import is a pretty killer feature.</p>

<p>TripIt and WorldMate have this and it was something I was planning to look into. That World Mate API could do me while the numbers were small, thanks for the link.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The other issue is that I only need super in depth trip planning every<br>
year or two, so I don’t think I would subscribe to such a tool.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s useful to know. The business model is going to be challenging.</p>

            <p>Some stream of consciousness feedback (sick and a bit tired over here). Looks like a nice tool. I use TripIt myself, which isn’t quite a travel planner in the sense that your tool is. However, I find it does help me to plan the trip from the top down. My typical planning workflow looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Book flights to and from destination. Check for “open jaw” itineraries as well.</li>
<li>Block off days for each intermediate destination</li>
<li>Book lodging at each location</li>
<li>Research and book transportation (trains, bus, car) between each destination</li>
<li>Fill in details: how to get from train station to hotel, buy show tickets, make reservations</li>
</ol>
<p>I could see your tool helping with the initial stages. My biggest planning challenges are the intermediate travel days, as I have to figure out local train/bus systems via their websites, which are of varying quality. However, TripIt’s auto-import is a pretty killer feature. You could get this for your app via the <a href="https://developers.worldmate.com/home.php" rel="nofollow noopener">World Mate API</a>. The other issue is that I only need super in depth trip planning every year or two, so I don’t think I would subscribe to such a tool.</p>

            <p>Thanks for those links. I’ve come across Dynamite Circle before, though they have quite a high bar for entry - $5000/month revenue. I wonder how many people here are part of it. The subreddit looks promising. I’ve always been put off by the UI of Reddit but I must try and give it another go.</p>

<p>That’s a good idea. I must try and find out where they congregate online.</p>

            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/markh">@markh</a>! Looks interesting but I know nothing about the genre, really.</p>
<p>For the Adwords issue try simplifying the landing page a lot and just try a few ads and pages until something works. Maybe try Facebook groups. Try the “digital nomad” type people - those who make startups and travel around, since they would be fairly comfortable with new tech and could give you good feedback?</p>
