    <title>I improved my landing page over the weekend, any feedback is appreciated</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/i-improved-my-landing-page-over-the-weekend-any-feedback-is-appreciated/1235</link>
    <description>This weekend I updated the landingpage for my project http://cyclingplanner.com/ 

I removed the old &quot;vague description + signup form&quot; page and replaced it with a more elaborate description of what the product does and I added few early product screenshots. The idea is that I update the copy and screenshots from time to time as the product evolves/matures.

Any feedback on the page is much appreciated. 

On a sidenote: Today I learned the hard why you should always test every aspect of your site on all major browsers. I had an IE bug in my Google Analytics event tracking code which resulted in the signup button not submitting the form. Due to this bug I have probably missed all signups from IE visitors (about 45% of total visitors)</description>

            <p>Thanks all for the feedback. This weekend I’m going to make some changes like improving copy, making sure it still looks good on wide screens and maybe find some compelling bike racing images so it becomes clear who the product is for.</p>

<ul>
<li>Watch your race results improve.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the whole reason for doing all this, right?</p>

            <p>Probably couldn’t hurt to tighten up the part above and below How It Works. It pushes the text of the three selling points below the fold.</p>
<p>Also the text next to the images further down the page could be spruced up a bit. A lot of “It does this” “It does that”. For example, in the first section you could do some bullets or subheads instead of short paragraphs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up a 52 week training plan</li>
<li>Define season goals and training objectives</li>
<li>Divide the year into training periods</li>
<li>Attach target training hours to each week</li>
<li>Track how well you are doing throughout the season.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Random tip - make sure to view your landing page on a screen that’s similar to what most of the world are using. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/11/move-over-1024x768-the-most-popular-screen-resolution-on-the-web-is-now-1366x768/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/11/move-over-1024x768-the-most-popular-screen-resolution-on-the-web-is-now-1366x768/</a></p>
<p>I use a screen resolution simulator and spotted that some of the key info on my page was below the fold, but with a minor adjustment, it came back up over the fold.</p>

            <p>I hope this doesn’t come off the wrong way but to me, as a potential customer who once raced mountain bikes, it just isn’t compelling.</p>
<p>All the low contrast text and the small screenshots that appear to show plain data tables just don’t get me thinking excitedly about racing.</p>
<p>Even if it’s a serious training product it doesn’t hurt to inspire your visitors with a little “bicycle porn”. A few good colorful pics of cyclists in action could help.</p>
<p>For example <a href="http://Strava.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Strava.com</a> has large size action-shots. I don’t think it’s vanity, I think they are there because any athlete tingles at the sight of these and as a result get in the right headspace for the product.</p>
<p>I hope that helps!</p>

            <p>Looks cool!  I might have used something like this back when I was racing.</p>
<p>My guess is that most racers probably use tech that collects data - heart rate, distance, speed, etc…    They’ll probably want to have that be an easy upload.  I would mention that.</p>
<p>The domain name is… ok, but might be better.  “Cycling” in the US is not the most associated word with competitive bike racing.  To me it brings up a family riding their bikes along the river or something like that - probably not your target market.</p>

            <p>I like it, general layout is good, it’s nice and simple, and it gives a good overview of the app.  A few suggestions though:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I’d put a max-width on “How does it work?” and “CyclingPlanner Features” sections.  It gets a bit separated on a wide screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the signup page there is this ‘change color’ setting on the top right, I’m not sure what this does except change the button color but I’d probably just remove it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If early access is free I’d probably stat that somewhere. That little work can really draw a user in.</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <p>I like the general layout and that you keep things simple. But I had a hard time reading the copy, the font is to bright. make it darker maybe a bit bigger. same goes with the screenshots, consider instead of showing  the full screenshot, to just show the relevant section. Screenshots should enlarge when you click on them. Good luck.</p>

            <p>Looks great, I like it. Clean and informative. The only suggestion I might make is to at least hint at the business model… Is it ad-supported, freemium, or something else? This way, early adopters know what they’re getting themselves into.</p>
<p>If it’s ad-supported, you can tout that it’s “free and always will be”, or if it’s freemium, you can perhaps offer early adopters the basic tier for free.</p>
