    <title>#161: The inglorious launch of my first product</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/161-the-inglorious-launch-of-my-first-product/7367</link>
    <description>This is a talk I recently gave at Barcelona’s ESIC business school. Ostensibly, I spoke on working with intangibles as products. But actually, I told the story of how I started as a bootstrapper – and revealed how clueless I was at the beginning.

So, if you are curious about how I got started creating and selling software products, then you’ll enjoy this episode.
