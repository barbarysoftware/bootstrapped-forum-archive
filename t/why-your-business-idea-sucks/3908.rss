    <title>Why Your Business Idea Sucks</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/why-your-business-idea-sucks/3908</link>
    <description>One of the questions that keeps coming up here is:

*I want to start a business, but can&#39;t come up with an idea.*

or

*Here is a list of ideas I came up with, help me choose the best one.*

I&#39;ve written an article to counter the thinking that you need an &quot;idea&quot; to start a business. This is a myth (I believe) that just won&#39;t die.

The article is written in a humorous and slightly tongue in cheek manner, so if that turns you off, you might want to skip this.

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/shantnu">@shantnu</a>, I was just lucky. When I did a market research, I found that there is a good and narrow market, so decided to put more efforts into the product. When I developed it for myself, I did not think about selling it to someone else. I needed no marketing, only SEO.</p>

            <p>I definitely think the key (in my 20+ experience of creating 20+ profitable software products) that LISTENING is key.  Your goal is to pass the test the customers give you. Why not CHEAT and ask them what’s on the test?</p>
<p>MeWare is fine as long as you represent a significant market.<br>
I.e, Joel created FogBugz to scratch his own itch, BUT he’s an experienced programmer and knew what he needed in a bug tracking program.<br>
Conversely, he also created CityDesk for blogging, but he didn’t realize the world was moving to online platforms for blogging so he lost out to WordPress.</p>

<p>Did you find marketing it hard, or easy? Usually with scratch-your-own-pains type products, you have to be very careful you are not creating a product for a market of one.</p>
<p>How did you avoid this problem?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the article. Agreed, there was no “idea” for my own product. It was a technical software solution for my own technical problem when I was working in office. I did it without even listening to the customers.</p>
