    <description>I&#39;m supposed to talk about my business model right?

That&#39;s a bit tricky because I&#39;m still figuring things out....

3 years ago I quit my full-time graphic design job and went freelance.

I think it was the 4-Hour Work Week book that got me interested in running a business, although it&#39;s taken me a while to come round to the idea of bootstrapping.

At this point I was blogging at http://cyclelove.net, but never figured out a way to make any money, despite it becoming quite a popular blog here in the UK.

Slowly I found my blog posts getting longer, and realised that I enjoyed writing, and even more surprisingly, that people enjoyed reading what I wrote.

2 years ago I started my current blog at http://greig.cc. It&#39;s written for people like me: creative people feeling trapped by their jobs, wanting to do their own thing, or just generally feeling a bit lost.

I try to write from the gut (and about topics that people don&#39;t often talk about, like depression), as well as covering practical aspects of bootstrapping such as design and copywriting.

Currently working on my first paid product ([a guide for people going freelance][1]) and living and working in S.E. London.

Oh and regarding bicycles, I have 3 at the moment. 2 road bikes, and 1 custom-built single speed beauty :smile:
