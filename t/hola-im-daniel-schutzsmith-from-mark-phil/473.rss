    <description>Hello everybody, I&#39;m Daniel Schutzsmith! 

**My Company** 

I&#39;m co-founder of [Mark &amp; Phil][1], a smallish digital creative agency that makes marketing &amp; fundraising easier for nonprofits. We&#39;ve been in business for 3 years, profitable since day 1, but we&#39;ve had to learn the hard way all along our journey.

**Our New Venture**

We&#39;re now attempting to pivot the company a bit to do less service and more productization of what we do. Our first product is [Awesome Cause][2], empowers nonprofits with the ability to create their own website that&#39;s super easy to setup and edit, while also utilizing simple CRM and fundraising features to build their supporter base. 

**How I Found Bootstrapped.fm**

As with most things bootstrap related, I heard about it from my friend and work neighbor @ian. I&#39;ve been catching up on all of the podcasts and am absolutely loving them. 

Looking forward to sharing what I&#39;ve learned and asking questions of the community on hurdles we may run into during this transition to more product driven revenue.

            <p>Awesome Cause sounds like a great idea - I’m part of a service business that went product (with a self hosted CMS) so I know something of the challenges. Welcome aboard!</p>
