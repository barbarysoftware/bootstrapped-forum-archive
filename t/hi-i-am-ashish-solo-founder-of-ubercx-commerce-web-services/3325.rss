    <description>Hi all, 
Long time lurker, finally I left my job and started my own startup **ubercx.io**  This startup is on path to provide APIs (or web services) on cloud. APIs provide business intelligence for e-commerce retailers. We recently launched very first API product &quot;show shipping tracking details&quot; embedded on customer order detail page. It&#39;s not niche concept, but we aim to provide similar APIs under same company. Of course, we also provide free plugins, integrated with major platforms like Magento, Shopify &amp; WooCommerce. (We have plans to add more platforms). Also soon we will be launching more APIs (along with their plugins).  We offer FREE plan too (http://ubercx.io/pricing). 

I would love to hear any feedback, whether it is positive (thanks) or constructive critique (thanks again). I am hoping to be more consistent contributor for bootstrapped and share &amp; learn here.</description>
