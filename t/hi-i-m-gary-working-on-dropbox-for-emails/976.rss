    <description>**The Site:**

Sharemoto.io encourages users to add hashtag to organize important email contents for later review. 

For personal use, it acts as Evernote for Email. In a team setting, emails no longer need to be CC because users can follow hashtags threads and email conversations becoming a Sharepoint / Dropbox for Emails.

**Demo:**

Video Demo &amp; Design Mockups - [http://garyyauchan.com/sharepoint-for-emails#gallery-311-2][2]

**Me:**

I&#39;m a self-taught developer and a designer focusing in the Enterprise space.

**Problems Being Solved:**

1) Personal - Help organize your important emails and group conversation threads regardless of subject header. *e.g. #taxes #feedback #mentor #mom #sister #anniversary_2014 #student_loan #mortgage*

2) Team Projects - Much of the content lives in the emails. Hashtagging relevant and milestone project emails into a central team access hub. This enable project progression tracking as oppose to creating a separate project log or copy and paste to a Wiki. *Similar to Sharepoint for Emails.*

3) Work - Replaces overwhelming, unnecessary or less-critical CC&#39;ed emails. Instead, invite users onto a Hashtag thread for them to read at their own time. *Similar to Google Docs.*

4) Search - Existing Search features are inadequate, jumbles up core and non-core contents. Really requires the user to remember the content/context of the email before search can begin.

5) Sharepoint - Mostly use as storing files. Lacks files context and project description.


**Use Cases:**

Personal Archiving: Targeting managers and team lead, and those professionals who have multiple conversation theme and topics. *e.g. #taxes #feedback #MicrosoftConference #references #intros #mentee #project_A #VC_deck*

Team Collaboration and Email Transparency: Spread usage to teams about project updates, and invite others to view. *e.g. Finance team can also view #storage strategies emails*


**Challenges:**

1) For personal use cases, why is it better than Starring, Tagging, Folder-ing in Gmail or Outlook?

2) User might question when/what to hashtag.

3) How can I get more beta testers? Sign up @ [www.sharemoto.io][3]
