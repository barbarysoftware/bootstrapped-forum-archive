    <title>Do you have an idea you&#39;d like to Validate *before* building an MVP? Did you find validation unhelpful? Want some free consulting?</title>

I&#39;m working on a course for Validating Your MVP. ([read a bit about that here][1]

This means validating the MVP before you build it. So maybe you&#39;d call that Validating Your Idea.
I want to test that process (ok, that&#39;s pretty meta). So I&#39;d like to talk to people who:

 - Have an idea and would **like to validate the idea**
 - Have **already validated and idea** and what they found helpful or not helpful.

If you&#39;ve got a fairly clear idea, this course could help you validate it and/or tweak it to get a better MVP-Market fit.

I am interviewing some startups to test this approach. I&#39;m looking for where it would help you and what might be missing from it.
You&#39;ll get some valuable free consulting. I&#39;ll get to test my approach.

(Please note: I previously offered the course free to anyone who I consulted with. Those free slots are all used up. Sorry :frowning: Also, I will only be able to do this for the first 3 to 5 responders.  You can email me directly via my profile.
