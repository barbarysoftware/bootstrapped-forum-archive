    <title>Category definition for Useful Links</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/category-definition-for-useful-links/53</link>
    <description>Find something really great other Bootstrappers could learn from? Post it up.

This category is experimental, but I know I come across useful links pretty often and having a place to discuss them and add to them beyond just sharing them on Twitter seems useful. It will also hopefully become a central place to look for &quot;that cool article on X&quot; vs searching the entire forum, twitter, etc.</description>
