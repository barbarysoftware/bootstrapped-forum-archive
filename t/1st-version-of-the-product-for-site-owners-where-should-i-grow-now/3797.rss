    <title>1st version of the product for site owners – where should I grow now?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/1st-version-of-the-product-for-site-owners-where-should-i-grow-now/3797</link>
    <description>Hi! I have launched 1st version of my new service: rank2traffic.com

It **helps webmasters and digital marketers to research competitors’ websites and find better niches**. 

I took me several months to collect the data and master algorithms. 
They are not perfect yet, but I find the estimates which service gives to be quite  good in most cases.

Now I have to decide – where should I grow in terms of new features/data? 

I am thinking about collecting and showing organic keywords for every site in the database (the search words which bring users to the website). Probably, I would be able to collect backlinks, which is also useful for SEO.
I made some experiments, and it seems like it is possible to do technically (and it will require a rebranding as well)

I also got a recommendation to show number of facebook likes/google +1 for every website.

--------------------------------------------
**Are there any ideas I may add? Is the SEO tools niche overcrowded already?** Finally, I am planning to add a paid section to the site, so information I give my customers should be very, very useful.

Would be happy to hear your considerations!

With best regards, 
Andrew</description>
