    <title>Featuring mini-course offer vs. book offer</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/featuring-mini-course-offer-vs-book-offer/4374</link>
    <description>I have a site, [AngularOnRails.com](https://www.angularonrails.com/), that&#39;s been doing pretty well lately. I launched a book about two weeks ago that has done a little over $1300 so far in sales. My email list grows by about 40 subscribers a week.

Although book sales have been good so far I want them to be better (duh).

Right now I&#39;m not featuring the book very prominently on my site. ([Here&#39;s a deep page so you can see an example](https://www.angularonrails.com/angular-2-tour-heroes-tutorial-rails-backend/).)

My thinking is that if somebody visits my site, I have an opportunity to sell the book to them about _once_, but if someone subscribes to my email list, I can sell the book (and other future products) to them over and over again indefinitely.

I&#39;m kind of copying Ramit Sethi&#39;s apparent strategy: all roads lead to his email list. He doesn&#39;t sell anything on his site (as far as I can tell), he only sells stuff through his email list.

I believe my thinking is right, I just wanna put this out there for feedback so I can stop this nagging voice in the back of my head.</description>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/richard">@Richard</a> I guess testing it wouldn’t be a bad idea.  Yeah, negative outcome would be fewer sales and subscribers.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/craigvn">@craigvn</a> For the foreseeable future I plan to focus exclusively and deeply on just Angular + Rails. I’m not sure where I’ll want to go after that.</p>

            <p>Have you considered doing different versions for different backends? For example, I think an Angular on Node would be popular. I have been doing a bit of Node recently and it is super easy to pick up.</p>

            <p>Test it? You can give it a prominent placement for a bit, see what sales look like, and add all buyers to your list anyway. They’ve already bought from you so you know they’re warmed up.</p>
<p>What would a negative outcome look like? Reduced buys + reduced subscribers?</p>
