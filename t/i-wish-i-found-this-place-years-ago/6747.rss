    <title>I wish I found this place years ago!</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/i-wish-i-found-this-place-years-ago/6747</link>
    <description>Hi, this is Ramin, from Cambridge, England. It’s so good to see a place virtually dedicated to the thing you are really passionate about - starting up a [software] company!

What do I do?
I help tech and software startups (of 1 to 9 people) offload their customer support (and bug fixing) - specially if it’s a cross platform or web based [GUI] application.

Who am I: Worked in games, in microchip/semi, film/vfx... helped others become millionaires three times, like everyone here been trying for financial independence on and off (e.g. udemy dot com/starting-up , visualSilicon , or sourceCREATOR dot io or lookup Mosaic3DX and CambridgeGameCreators...) none of which have been much of a break through.

I am a diver, was born in the mid-east, am a good cook and I’ll tell you my favourite drink only at a real bar haha

Why am I here?
Networking, Learning, Making Good Friends, and maybe even finding a Co-Founder - who knows.</description>

</aside>
<p>We try to remove posts quickly from newly signed-up users that are self promotion, especially those that are not offering anything of value to bootstrappers. It is mostly automated, and hopefully most site members never even notice this happening.</p>

            <p>I guess being 54 years old and running a solo mISV since 2005 does qualify me as an ‘old timer’.</p>
<p>I have a t-shirt with a picture of a dinosaur captioned “No I am not creating a web app”. ;0)</p>

            <p>I was trying to keep his name a secret but you may have just given it away <a class="mention" href="/u/andy">@Andy</a>  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/joy.png?v=9" title=":joy:" class="emoji" alt=":joy:"></p>
<p>Not sure why I started using that phrase recently. It’s the second time this year and it has the same reaction. It’s not a bad one though, is it? From the dictionary: “ a very experienced or long-serving person“.</p>
<p>Being a real ISV for 10+ years does certainly qualify <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Personal website, no, but maybe I should. I am easy to find on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>And the “customer support and bug fixing” service I mentioned is too new to have a site yet (I was pointed at this forum talking about it to one of your old timers <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ).</p>
