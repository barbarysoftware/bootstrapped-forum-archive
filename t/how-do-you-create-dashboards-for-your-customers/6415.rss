    <title>How do you create dashboards for your customers?</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/how-do-you-create-dashboards-for-your-customers/6415</link>
    <description>Hi there,

I am running a saas app and I want my customers to have a dashboard inside their account showing relevant information to them. 

For example how many leads they have generated, emails have been send out, number of clicks on a CTA button etc.  So its a mix of data coming for different areas of the product that I would like to show over time (nice chats, KPIs,...) 

Now I am facing the typical question of &quot;make or buy&quot;:

- Make: I would have to query my databases, possibly aggregate data and collect events across the product. Also I would have to use some chart.js to build the dashboard in the frontend.

- Buy: I have to find a tool/service that collects my data and offers me a good integration API to display it in the customers account dashboard page.

I suppose I am not the only one having a customer facing dashboard. 
So what solution (make/buy) did you pick for your app and what was the reason? Any recommendations?

Thanks!

            <p>I have dashboards in my system and I always created my own. There are some tools that could be used but they tend to be expensive and not really that easy to seamlessly integrate. They are enterprisey.</p>

            <p>Some BI tools like <a href="http://datastudio.google.com">datastudio.google.com</a> or <a href="http://analytics.zoho.com">analytics.zoho.com</a> are dedicated to create dashboards, using various sources of data (incl. from pgsql / mysql).<br>
They also let you embed their visualizations in html.<br>
Granted, these are not aimed specifically at SaaS, but that could be a very effort-efficient way to create nice-looking dashboards — at least as a 1st step.</p>
<p>We wrote a quick introduction to Data Studio if you want to see what it is:<br>

<p>Data Studio is a powerful tool for turning data into dashboards and reports. It's part of Google's Marketing Platform.</p>

</p>
<p>However, I agree with <a class="mention" href="/u/stevemcleod">@SteveMcLeod</a> that there could be value in doing your own dashboard — especially once your idea of what your dashboard should do has matured.</p>
<p>A good middle-ground could be to use ready-made dashboard themes, where all the visualizations and charts are already done, and you “just” have to plug in your data (which you’ll have to do somehow anyway).</p>
<p>E.g. Bootstrap proposes a lot of clean templates, in plain html or react / vue / etc.:<br>

<p>A quick search will give you a lot more options, depending on the CSS framework you’re already using, the price you’re willing to pay, etc.</p>

            <p>Sorry I was not clear: a Trello board is <strong>shared</strong> with the each beta customer and acts as a shared  “dashboard” for new feature development and testing status. I think it’s relevant but not exactly what you were looking for.</p>

            <p>Thanks, maybe the title was a bit misleading. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/grimacing.png?v=9" title=":grimacing:" class="emoji" alt=":grimacing:"><br>
But I don’t need a dashboard about my customers. The customer (my customer) should have a dashboard showing his metics. My app helps sending out voucher codes so my clients want to see how many codes they have send out each day etc. thru my app.</p>

            <p>This may or may not be a relevant answer but <a href="https://www.trafficparrot.com">TrafficParrot</a>  creates a separate Trello board for each beta customer to track the status of major enhancements and new features as they are tested internally, deployed, and then reviewed / evaluated by beta customers to see if they are ready for prime time.</p>

            <p>Hey Steve,</p>
<p>thanks for the reply. I found something but it looks a bit enterprise/expensive to me <a href="https://keen.io/">https://keen.io/</a>  Not sure if you could have done your dashboard with their api.</p>
<p>Would be nice to get some hints from other people. Anyone? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>I’ve created the customer dashboard in Feature Upvote (my B2B SaaS) manually. It could be better (as some customers tell me), but it could be much worse!</p>
<p>I didn’t even consider buying a ready-made solution because I wasn’t aware that such a thing existed. Do you know anyone? If so, I’m keen to check them out.</p>
<p>I probably would have built it myself anyway. That’s because it is a key part of our app, and something we want to have fine control over appearance and functionality.</p>
