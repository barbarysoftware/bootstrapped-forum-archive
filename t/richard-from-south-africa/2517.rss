    <description>I can&#39;t believe I only found out about this forum now! Good timing, though, since I&#39;m really keen to find a smaller forum than HN that&#39;s focused a bit more on bootstrapper needs.

I&#39;m Richard from Johannesburg, South Africa.  I used to post on the old BOS forum around the time I was focused on Tudumo. I&#39;ve been tinkering with a couple SaaS apps, at least one of which I&#39;ll release in the next few months. I&#39;ve been listening to various bootstrapper podcasts over the last year, but somehow missed this forum. It already feels like &#39;my people&#39; :smile:

One semi-goal is to possibly get to a conference this year, possibly Microconf EU. Let&#39;s see how that goes.</description>

            <p>Hi Dennis!  Yup, licensed 20 May 2009 - I still have your license if you ever need it <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<p>I’m always amazed at how many ways there are to solve such a simple and common problem. There will always be new todo lists, I think.</p>
<p>If you’re on the Mac, check out <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper</a> - seems similar-ish to what you’re talking about. Jesse’s also a really nice guy.</p>

            <p>Hi Richard, welcome to the forum. I was an avid Tudumo user when I was still using Windows a couple of years ago. It was a great app. I’ve been thinking lately that a simple text-based todo app (possibly as a SaaS for syncing + native apps) could actually do quite well. I know it’s a very crowed market, but I noticed that many people keep coming back to text files or Mac’s synchronized Notes app to manage their to-dos (me included).</p>
<p>Something basic with super fast input/marking items as done/grouping etc. Possibly adding support for teams later. Maybe market it as Todos for Hackers. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> If somebody is interested in working on this, let me know and I’m happy to share additional ideas/provide input.</p>
