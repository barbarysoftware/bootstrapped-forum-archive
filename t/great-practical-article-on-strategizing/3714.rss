    <title>Great, practical article on strategizing</title>

    <description>
Recently, there was great discussion here on taking a month to work on a side project.

I was just reading his[ article by Talyor Pearson](https://medium.com/@ctaylormpearson/antifragile-planning-optimizing-for-optionality-without-chasing-shiny-objects-4e5fcb130e08#.bpeddks7a)  which is very applicable that topic, but has even broader application.

Taylor has written some good stuff before.  He touches on some points I&#39;ve realized in the last 6 months. I am *now* focusing on how *little* I can do. (As someone said:  there is your #1 priority and then there is everything else). When you approach it that way, recognizing your time as incredibly valuable (and scare) you ask &quot;why is this important? What is the goal? How will I know if I&#39;ve succeeded. Stuff that Taylor covers in the article better than I can describe it.

I have let myself get spread too thin.

On solution to that is to really think deeply about what your most important goal is and how best to accomplish it. It&#39;ll make you more confident and less likely to get distracted by the Urgent, Unimportant Shiny Objects.

And that&#39;s exactly what Taylor is writing about, as he draws from a variety of sources including the great Venn Diagram below from Reid Hoffman.
