    <title>From email address to sales prospect / lead</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/from-email-address-to-sales-prospect-lead/3725</link>
    <description>What are you guys using to extract leads from an email list? More specifically, I need to go through an email list and filter out all the email adresses for people working in agencies.

I know Clearbit can do something like this, but I&#39;m not sure how good it is. Their free trial quota is way too low to tell if it works or not. Does anyone have experiences to share?

I was thinking about outsourcing it. Good or bad idea? Suggestions?

Thanks!</description>

            <p>Thank you for writing this!</p>
<p>I think Clearbit would probably be the easier version of using Rapportive. Outsourcing it definitely makes sense. Days of copy/pasting stuff is a big motivation killer!</p>
<p>Sponsoring events is a good idea!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I recommend trying rapportive or a similar service.<br>
Paste the emails into an email you send yourself, then hover them with your mouse, opening their linkedin’s or websites.</p>
<p>Definitely outsource this; I’ve done email sourcing manually and it’s probably your biggest barrier to actually getting this done—it’s no fun.</p>
<p>I’m planning to sign up for salesfuelapp/fiverr/fancyhands in the next few days to get some help with my own sourcing. If you charge enough for your service, outreachsignals could be a good thing to try as well.</p>
<p>Good luck &amp; please report back!</p>
<p>Also, consider sponsoring events that agency people attend. Frequently sponsors get access to everyone’s emails.</p>
