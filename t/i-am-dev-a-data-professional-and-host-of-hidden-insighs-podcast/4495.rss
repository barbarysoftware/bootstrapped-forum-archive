    <description>Really happy to join bootstrapped community. I am a data &amp; business intelligence professional and host of soon-to-be-launched hidden insights podcast. Not sure, if starting a podcast is considered an bootstrapped venture :-) but I look forward to interacting with all of you. I am located in Washington DC region.</description>
