    <title>I&#39;m Cory and I make things on the web (original, right?)</title>

    <description>Hey, everyone!

I&#39;m Cory LaViska and I&#39;m responsible for a few things you may have seen in the wild.

My main focus right now is a SaaS content management system called [Surreal CMS](http://www.surrealcms.com/) which is in its fifth year of operation.

I also maintain [some other free tools](http://www.abeautifulsite.net/services) for web designers/developers as well as a handful of open-source projects on GitHub.

I&#39;ve been a web developer for over a decade and a founder/bootstrapper since 2007. I recently moved back to my home state of New Hampshire where the tech industry is really starting to blossom. If you&#39;re in the greater Boston area, let me know and maybe we can connect at a local meet-up sometime.

It&#39;s not often that I join communities like this, but it feels like a good fit and there are a lot of good people around here. I can&#39;t wait to &quot;meet&quot; everyone!
