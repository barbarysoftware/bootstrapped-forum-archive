    <title>Testers wanted: Product to increase conversions of AdWords traffic</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/testers-wanted-product-to-increase-conversions-of-adwords-traffic/1746</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,

I&#39;m building a SaaS product that will hopefully increase conversions on your landing pages for visitors coming from AdWords campaigns. Right now I&#39;m looking for some companies or marketers interested in being early beta testers or giving me feedback. 

If you&#39;d like to beta test such a product and you:

 * Spend at least a couple thousand dollars a month on AdWords (if you don&#39;t, this product probably won&#39;t move the needle too much for you).

 * Run several different AdWords campaigns or ads all pointing to the same landing page (if you spend all your money on one ad copy, because you found that&#39;s what works for you and don&#39;t experiment much with it, then this product is not for you).

 If you fit the profile and want to know more, I&#39;d love to talk. Hopefully once I explain what the product does you can tell me what you think and if you&#39;re interested in being a beta tester (no strings attached, though).

 Thanks!

            <p>Good luck Manuel. I’m not in your target audience, so I won’t volunteer. But I wish you success.</p>
