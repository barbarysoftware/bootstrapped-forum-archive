    <title>Bootstrapped #112: Three ways to use podcasts for marketing</title>
    <link>https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/t/bootstrapped-112-three-ways-to-use-podcasts-for-marketing/6616</link>
    <description>https://simplecast.com/s/44522fbd

Craig Hewitt from [Castos](https://castos.com/) and [Rogue Startups](https://roguestartups.com/) joins me again.

Craig and I discuss how bootstrappers can use the podcasting ecosystem to promote their products.

We discuss three ways to use podcasts - and the pros and cons of each:

1. Start and run your own podcast
2. Do the &quot;podcast circuit&quot; as an interesting guest with riveting insights
3. Sponsor podcasts 

We &#39;go meta&#39; and talk about why Steve has launched the new iteration of the Bootstrapped podcast.

We also talk about:

* &quot;credit card required upfront&quot; trials versus &quot;no credit card required&quot; trials.
* the life-cycle email sequences using activity-based triggers that we&#39;ve recently added to Feature Upvote.
* the danger of applying data-based marketing approaches to products when your product doesn&#39;t have enough data
* why Steve doesn&#39;t do A/B testing - yet</description>
