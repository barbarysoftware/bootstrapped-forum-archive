    <title>Hello everyone, I&#39;m Yemi, finding a voice!</title>

    <description>Hi all,

I&#39;m Yemi, I recently started thinking about how to step out on my own having had experience as a developer and now working as development manager and came across bootstrapped.fm which I have really enjoyed.

I am still trying to find a product idea but as a start am working with a friend to kick start a blog focused on the alignment of technical and project management aspects of product delivery. 

I also have other blogging projects in the pipeline particularly around writing about my journey of using grails, a Java framework, and BDD for any product I eventually come up with.

I hope to be a fully involved member of this forum.

Cheers</description>

            <p>Thanks Andy for the suggestion.</p>
<p>We are currently working on how we’ll pitch the blog as am from the technical side whilst my friend is a project manager.</p>
<p>Our thinking is to blog about the distrust/communication gap between the different groups (stakeholders, product managers/project managers, design/ux, developers ) that need to deliver projects.</p>

<p>Hi Yemi,</p>
<p>That sounds quite abstract! You might want to re-frame it as something more concrete and business focussed (e.g. ‘how to talk to developers’).</p>
